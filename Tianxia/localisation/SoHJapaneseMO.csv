japanese_pilgrimage;Go on a Pilgrimage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_pilgrimage_desc;Set out on a pilgrimage. If Buddhist, you will have a choice between destinations in Japan and other destinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_MNM_8001;A destination in Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_1;You have decided to embark on a pilgrimage to a significant site for the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. It will doubtlessly be a long journey, but you still feel that it will be a worthwhile endeavor, and doubtlessly others belonging to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith will look on you more favorably once you return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_1;I will prove my devotion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_2;The kami are everywhere, and so are their servants and shrines. However, for anyone to take your pilgrimage seriously you need to visit a more significant site than most, and thus you have fewer avaliable options.\n\nWhere do you wish to go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_2;I will visit the court of the [the_tenno.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_2;I will visit the grand shrine at Ise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_2;I will walk the Kumano route!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SHINTO_2;I will visit Mount Fuji!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_3;There are certain sites in Japan that would be suitable to visit as a Buddhist pilgrim, and those are generally where such a pilgrim would go, but as the Buddhist faith is rather more widespread and the Buddha was born in India there are of course also other sites you might wish to consider.\n\nWhere do you wish to go?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_3;I will visit the many sites in Shikoku!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_3;I will visit Mount Koya!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_3;I will head outside Japan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_6;A pilgrim is generally expected to be an ascetic during their pilgrimage, and thus should avoid various immoral actions. You have been considering this during your pilgrimage, but as it would be rather shameful to fail to be ascetic after deciding to attempt it you are not quite sure if it is something that you will be doing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_6;Ascetism is commendable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_6;Ascetism isn't for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_7;One day during your pilgrimage you encounter a wandering priest devoted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. He inquires about your pilgrimage so far and is quite pleased when you tell him that you are making an effort to be ascetic, telling you that it is commendable and something that many struggle with. He wishes you well before departing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_7;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_8;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have been considering your approach to many things differently, and you have come to conclude that one of your flaws is that you are rather proud. As you are aware of this, you have become better at avoiding this flaw, which certainly is a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_8;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_9;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have been considering your approach to many things differently, and you have come to conclude that one of your flaws is that you are rather gluttonous. As you are aware of this, you have become better at avoiding this flaw, which certainly is a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_9;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_10;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have been considering your approach to many things differently, and you have come to conclude that one of your flaws is that you are rather lustful. As you are aware of this, you have become better at avoiding this flaw, which certainly is a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_10;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_11;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have been considering your approach to many things differently. Though you would not have said that you were overly proud, you have still concluded that you could stand to become a bit more humble, and in this you are definitely taking a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_11;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_12;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have been considering your approach to many things differently. Though you would not have said that you were overly gluttonous, you have still concluded that you could stand to become a bit more temperate, and in this you are definitely taking a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_12;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_13;After making the decision to try to be ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have been considering your approach to many things differently. Though you would not have said that you were overly lustful, you have still concluded that you could stand to become a bit more chaste, and in this you are definitely taking a step in the right direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_13;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_14;Though you decided that you wanted to be more ascetic during your pilgrimage, you have not really been making much of an effort, and after a while on the road you conclude that you will not be able to really devote yourself to this. Though nobody else might have noticed, it is still a bit shameful to know that you failed to do the right thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_14;At least I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_15;One day during your pilgrimage you encounter a wandering priest devoted to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. He inquires about your pilgrimage so far and is quite pleased when you tell him that you are making an effort to be ascetic, but when he learns just how little effort you have put into it he gets upset and calls you out on not being as devout as you should be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_15;At least I tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_16;You decided that being ascetic during your pilgrimage was not something you were interested in, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on your faith and try to better yourself you have instead been reconsidering how strictly you should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong of you to be a bit more proud.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_16;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_17;You decided that being ascetic during your pilgrimage was not something you were interested in, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on your faith and try to better yourself you have instead been reconsidering how strictly you should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong of you to be a bit more gluttonous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_17;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_18;You decided that being ascetic during your pilgrimage was not something you were interested in, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on your faith and try to better yourself you have instead been reconsidering how strictly you should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong of you to be a bit more lustful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_18;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_19;You decided that being ascetic during your pilgrimage was not something you were interested in, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on your faith and try to better yourself you have instead been reconsidering how strictly you should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong of you to be a bit less humble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_19;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_20;You decided that being ascetic during your pilgrimage was not something you were interested in, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on your faith and try to better yourself you have instead been reconsidering how strictly you should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong of you to be a bit less temperate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_20;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_21;You decided that being ascetic during your pilgrimage was not something you were interested in, and though a pilgrimage is a time to reflect on your faith and try to better yourself you have instead been reconsidering how strictly you should follow its teachings, concluding that it would not necessarily be wrong of you to be a bit less chaste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_21;I must be true to myself...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_22;You knew that there possibly would be those that would be unhappy when you made the decision not to focus on ascetism during your pilgrimage, and you have been worrying a bit about someone lecturing you about it, but as far as you can tell nobody has seemed to care about you being less than ascetic during your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_22;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_23;One day on the road you come across a crippled dog with only three remaining legs. It appears to have trouble walking, and whimpers from time to time. Though you know that you are supposed to refrain from killing during a pilgrimage, it is perhaps the lesser evil in a situation like this, since the dog is suffering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_23;I won't take its life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_23;I can give it a quick death...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_23;It doesn't know suffering... yet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_24;The dog follows you for a while despite having trouble walking, and it makes you feel rather sad that you cannot help it in any way. However, as you reach the next village one of the villagers takes pity on the dog and declares that he will adopt it and do what he can for it, which certainly is a welcome development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_24;It is good that someone cares!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_25;Leaving the crippled dog behind, you find yourself reflecting on your normal approach to things, which often is violent, and perhaps a bit more cruel than it has to be. Though you would not go as far as to say that it is always wrong to use violence, you come to the conclusion that you should try to be a bit less violent in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_25;I should be kinder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_26;You leave the crippled dog behind, but find your thoughts returning to it several times during the following days. Though you could not have brought it with you, you feel that there have been other situations in the past where you could have been a bit more helpful, and you decide that you shoudl try to focus more on kindness in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_26;Kindness is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_27;You leave the crippled dog behind, but find your thoughts returning to it several times during the following days. It was unfortunate that you could not help it, but as the only option you saw was to give it the mercy of a quick death and that would not have been in line with what is expected of you during a pilgrimage there was nothing you could do about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_27;Poor dog!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_28;You draw your sword and approach the dog, striking swiftly and killing it before it can react. Unfortunately for you, another pilgrim is walking by as it happens, and he sees fit to berate you, claiming that it is more important for you to focus on your pilgrimage and what is proper during that than anything else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_28;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_29;There was a time where you would not have seen fit to make the suffering of an animal shorter and perhaps even would have seen fit to make it more drawn out, but you have decided that that is behind you and grant the dog a swift death. Though you would not go as far as to renounce violence, cruelty is something you feel you should refrain from in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_29;That was a kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_30;You draw your sword and approach the dog, striking swiftly and killing it before it can react. Though killing is not something you are supposed to do during a pilgrimage, letting an animal suffer needlessly seems worse to you. Though a mercy kill is not something most people would consider a kindness, you do, and you resolve to also be kind in other ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_30;That was a kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_31;You draw your sword and approach the dog, striking swiftly and killing it before it can react. With that done, you wipe your sword clean and sheathe it once more, then continue on your way. Your pilgrimage is far from over, and you cannot afford to be distracted by this matter or any other, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_31;That was a kindness...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_32;The crippled dog suspects nothing as you approach, and a precise cut with your sword severs one of the tendons in one of its remaining legs. It lets out a sound that is half a growl and half a whimper as it attempts to escape, but you ensure that it cannot, and you spend the rest of the day inflicting further tortures on the creature before it finally dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_32;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_33;The crippled dog suspects nothing as you approach, and a precise cut with your sword severs one of the tendons in one of its remaining legs. It lets out a sound that is half a growl and half a whimper as it attempts to escape, but you ensure that it cannot, and you spend the rest of the day inflicting further tortures on the creature before it finally dies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_33;That ended too soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_34;You have been told that a pilgrim following the [Root.Religion.GetName] religion should avoid saying anything that could be considered immoral to a [Root.GetAppropriateAttractionTarget] during the pilgrimage, and it is something you have been trying to keep in mind. However, in one village along the road to your destination you come across an attractive [Root.GetAppropriateAttractionTarget], and you start to wonder if immorality really is wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_34;I can say some immoral things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_34;It is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_35;The [Root.GetAppropriateAttractionTarget] does not appreciate what you say, and tell you that you should know better than to engage in such behavior during a pilgrimage before leaving. Though word of what happened hopefully won't spread, you still feel a bit humiliated by the experience, and you are convinced that you made a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_35;It was just a joke!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_36;The [Root.GetAppropriateAttractionTarget] ignores your immoral words and leaves without comment. You are not certain what they thought of what you said, but it is quite clear that it was not as effective as you would have liked, and perhaps it was a mistake to not adhere to the supposed rules for a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_36;That could have gone worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_37;The [pilgrims_lover.GetManWoman] is quite receptive to your words, and [pilgrims_lover.GetSheHe] gives you a smile and suggests that perhaps the two of you should head somewhere more private to continue your discussion, or perhaps to engage in certain other activities that might be of interest to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_37;But of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_37;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_38;[pilgrims_lover.GetBestName] and you spend the night in each other's arms, and when the morning comes and you are about to leave [pilgrims_lover.GetSheHe] asks you whether the two of you ever will meet again, evidently hoping that that will be the case. You cannot bring [pilgrims_lover.GetHerHim] with you on your journey, of course, but that does not necessarily mean you must be apart forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_38;I have a place for you at home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_38;I don't want to see you again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_39;You resolve to say nothing immoral and continue on your way. A few villages later you overhear another pilgrim make immoral comments nearby, and the townspeople are quick to berate him, and he is clearly humiliated by the experience, so it is likely that you made the right decision before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_39;Something to remember...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_40;Though there was a time when you would have seen fit to make immoral comments to nearly every [Root.GetAppropriateAttractionTarget] you thought would be receptive, you have started to feel that this is something that you should put behind you, not just for the duration of the pilgrimage but perhaps forever, as you want to try to be a better person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_40;Begone, lust!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_41;You continue on your way and reflect on what you choose not to do a bit during the following days. Though you previously have not felt overly strongly on the subject of chastity, you are starting to feel differently now, and you resolve to live your life in a chaste fashion from now on, as that is only appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_41;Chastity is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_42;You decide not to make an immoral comment and continue on your way, not feeling particularly strongly about the decision and not thinking too much about it over the course of the next few days. After all, you are on an important journey and have plenty of things to think about, and cannot afford to dwell on a small detail overly long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_42;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_43;You are aware that one of the rules pilgrims are supposed to adhere to during a pilgrimage is to abstain from alcohol, and you have been doing that so far even though you usually drink some on a somewhat frequent basis. However, one evening when you are having a meal at an inn one of the patrons there offers to buy you a drink, and you start to wonder if it perhaps is permissible to accept his offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_43;Sorry, but I don't drink!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_43;One drink won't hurt...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_44;The patron that offered to buy you a drink seems a bit surprised by you turning down his offer, and he leaves the inn before long, possibly to look for a drinking partner elsewhere. After he has left some of the other patrons note that the man has made a habit of trying to trick pilgrims into drinking and that many pilgrims fail to refuse. They are evidently quite impressed by your resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_44;I made the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_45;You refuse the offer of a drink, and the man who offered it to you merely shrugs and goes looking for another drinking partner. Noting that their behavior becomes worse and worse during the course of the evening as they drink more and more, you decide that you made the right decision, and also decide that you should try to be a bit more temperate in general to avoid similar excesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_45;Temperance is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_46;You refuse the offer of a drink, and the man who offered it to you merely shrugs and goes looking for another drinking partner. The rest of the evening is uneventful, and you have a good night's sleep and a quick breakfast shortly after dawn before once more setting off on your journey, eager to reach your destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_46;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_47;You accept the man's offer to buy you a drink, and once you start drinking you find that you have been missing it more than you thought you had. You order some more drinks after finishing the first, and decide that you really should not focus so much on temperance in the future as it simply is not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_47;I can indulge some more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_48;You accept the man's offer to buy you a drink, and drink it slowly once you receive it, intending for it to be the only drink you have. Before you have finished your drink another pilgrim enters the common room of the inn and notices that you are drinking, and he is quick to call you out for not avoiding alcohol during your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_48;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_49;You accept the man's offer to buy you a drink, and drink it slowly once you receive it, intending for it to be the only drink you have. You have no trouble keeping that promise to yourself, and the evening passes without anything notable happening. After a good night's sleep you have a quick breakfast before leaving the inn, eager to reach your destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_49;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_50;You accept the man's offer to buy you a drink, and down in quickly after you receive it. Finding it to your taste, you order another, and then several more after that. The rest of the evening is a blur, and the next morning you wake up on the floor of the common room with a severe headache, which gets worse every time someone speaks louder than a whisper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_50;That... was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_51;One day on the road you come across a fellow pilgrim. The woman does not look pleased to see that she has company all of a sudden, and when it becomes clear that the two of you are heading in the same direction she starts complaining about how you have ruined the pilgrimage before launching into a series of rather grave insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_51;I cannot let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_51;I should try to de-escalate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_52;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other. You are quite certain that she is the unreasonable party.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_52;I am right, you are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_53;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other. A [Root.GetManWoman] such as yourself should not have to endure such poor company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_53;I deserve better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_54;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other. Though you would consider yourself a humble person, you deserve better than this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_54;I am not at fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_55;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other, as your patience has reached its limit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_55;I have no patience for fools!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_56;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other, and you feel more than justified in returning her insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_56;The time for kindness is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_57;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other, and you inform the woman that she will pay dearly the next time she insults you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_57;Insult me and you'll regret it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_58;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other, and you see no reason to hold back when it comes to returning the insults with interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_58;Run away and cry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_59;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She will have none of it, and it is not long before the two of you are shouting at each other. Your quarrel attracts the attention of a priestess that is passing by, and she berates both of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_59;I didn't start it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_60;You inform the woman that she is in the wrong when it comes to her unreasonable expectation that no other pilgrim should walk the same road as her, and also tell her that she owes you an apology for the insults. She declares that she is unwilling to share the road with your or give you an apology, and takes off in a different direction as soon as she can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_60;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_61;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Though you felt tempted to return her insults with interest, you conclude that it was the right decision to go for something more diplomatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_61;Cruelty is uncalled for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_62;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Though you felt tempted to threaten her with violence when she insulted you, you conclude that it was the right decision to go for something more diplomatic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_62;I know how to keep my temper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_63;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Though there are many that would have gone for something more violent or that would have returned the insults, you feel that approaching the matter with kindness was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_63;Kindness is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_64;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Though there are many that would have gone for something more violent or that would have returned the insults, you feel that approaching the matter with patience was correct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_64;Patience is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_65;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Though you usually would not have been willing to accept something as simple as an apology, you are on a pilgrimage to better yourself, and thus you feel that ignoring your pride might be good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_65;I should be humber!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_66;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. There are those that would not have considered a mere apology acceptable after their pride was injured, but you are not them, and you feel that being humble often is the right call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_66;Humility is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_67;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Though you are rather less insistent than you usually would have been, it clearly worked out in your favor, and you conclude that you should be less stubborn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_67;Stubborness is overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_68;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and she listens to your words before offering you what appears to be a sincere apology. Over the next few days, you look back at some other incidents in the past and start seeing how you could have handled them more diplomatically.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_68;I know what to say now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_69;You calmly explain to the woman that you are just another pilgrim and that this is the only reasonable route for you to take, and though she calms down a bit she tells you that she prefers solitude even so, conceding that she could be the one to take a different route. True to her words, she elects to head off in a different direction almost immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_69;Perhaps it is for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_70;Before setting off on your pilgrimage you made the customary donations to nearby temples to prove your devotion, but even so you brought with you quite a bit of money on your journey. Recently, you have been consideringt he fact that this is not quite in line with what is expected of you during a pilgrimage, and you have concluded that perhaps it would be wise to make another donation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_70;I can give a bit more to charity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_70;I have given more than enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_71;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. They are quite grateful to receive such a donation, and tell you that it is good that you saw fit to give to charity after you decided that you had too much money with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_71;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_72;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. After leaving, you start considering just how much money you normally have been earning compared to how much you have been able to spend, and you conclude that you easily could do with less.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_72;Greed is overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_73;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. Later on, you start considering whether you could donate to temples more often, and conclude that it should be rather easily achieved, as you have more than enough money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_73;Charity is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_74;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. Normally, you would consider doing so a bit beneath you, but you have decided that you should better yourself during your pilgrimage and that becoming more humble is the right move.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_74;Pride is a problem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_75;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. They are a bit surprised to learn that you were willing to set your own good aside after you learned that you had too much money, but they praise you for being humble enough to admit that you made a mistake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_75;I don't mind being humble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_76;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there. They praise you for your kindness, and you take their words to heart and decide that from now on you should endeavor to be kind more often than you have been in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_76;I should be kind more often!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_77;You make sure to stop by the next temple you come across to hand over a substantial amount of money to the [Root.Religion.GetName] priests found there, and then leave the temple right away. You have yet to reach your destination, after all, and cannot afford to be distracted by minor things along the road.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_77;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_78;You are in the middle of a discussion with a [Root.Religion.GetName] priest at a small shrine when you suddenly notice that the sun is lower on the horizon than you had thought it was. Since you are supposed to make sure that you get to your inn before dark during a pilgrimage, you might need to leave sooner rather than later, even though the priest might be upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_78;I must depart at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_78;I can stay a while and listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_79;The priest is surprised at first when you interrupt him and says that you need to leave at once, but then he notices just how low the sun is on the horizon and tells you that he is sorry to have taken up so much of your time. Furthermore, he says that it is rather refreshing to meet a pilgrim that actually cares about adhering to the rules for a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_79;I knew he'd understand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_80;You take your leave and hurry away from the temple, doing your best to make up for lost time. Though you'd normally have taken it rather easy, you have come to the conclusion that that is not what you really want to do, and you resolve to become less slothful in order to better yourself during your pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_80;I cannot afford to rest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_81;You take your leave and hurry away from the temple, doing your best to make up for lost time. You are no stranger to working hard at times when something unexpected happens, and as you hurry towards the next village you decide that you should make an effort to always work hard from now on to perhaps pre-empt the need to rush at the very end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_81;I must work hard to succeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_82;The priest is surprised when you interrupt him and says that you need to leave at once. When you tell him that it is getting late and that you need to hurry if you are to reach the next village with an inn before dark, he gets annoyed and tells you that you should not have stopped in the first place if you did not think to plan ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_82;I would have thought he'd be pleased...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_83;You stay at the temple until the priest finally is done talking, at which point the sun barely is above the horizon. You are unsure whether you could reach the nearest village with an inn before dark if you made an effort or not, but you decide that it is not really worth trying, and that there is nothing wrong with taking it easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_83;I can afford to relax...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_84;You stay at the temple until the priest finally is done talking, at which point the sun barely is above the horizon. Though you perhaps could have made it to the nearest village with an inn before dark, you decide that it really is not worth the effort to do so, and as you head off at a rather slow pace you decide that you need ot learn to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_84;I can't work all the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_85;The priest keeps talking for a good while and it is almost dark before he finally stops. As you prepare to leave he takes the time to tell you that you really should have been more mindful of the fact that you needed to depart sooner. It is rather clear that he does not seem to think that the fact that he kept talking was why you remained where you were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_85;But I didn't want to upset you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_86;The priest keeps talking for a good while and it is almost dark before he finally stops. He is evidently aware of the fact that this makes it unlikely that you will reach an inn before dark, as he makes sure to tell you that you need not worry about that as keeping him company and listening to him without interruption certainly is an acceptable reason not to arrive at an inn before dark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_86;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_87;It is almost dark before the priest stops talking long enough for you to leave, and you find yourself racing the sunset as you hurry towards where you think that the nearest village is located. Twilight has arrived by the time that you enter the inn, but twilight is not the same as darkness, so you managed to get there in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_87;I barely made it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_88;You wake up well before dawn one morning and cannot fall asleep again, and you start to wonder whether it would be a good idea to set off early so that you perhaps might reach your destination sooner. You know that you technically are not supposed to leave your inn during the night during a pilgrimage unless it is unavoidable, but perhaps it would be permissible if you move towards your goal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_88;An early start is right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_88;There are rules to follow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_89;You head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering your belongings and setting off from the inn. As you depart you consider the fact that you normally would have been willing to wait patiently for things to happen, but it has at times been rather difficult, and you don't really feel that it is something you want to do moving forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_89;Maybe I'm a bit impatient...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_90;You head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering your belongings and setting off from the inn. You are no stranger to not resting when there is something to do, and looking back you can see how being a bit more diligent would have been beneficial. Since you are on a pilgrimage partially to better yourself, you resolve to become more diligent from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_90;I must not waste time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_91;You head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering your belongings and setting off from the inn. Normally, you would have welcomed any excuse to take it easy, but you have started to come to the conclusion that that is often detrimental, and you resolve to be less slothful in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_91;I must work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_92;You head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering your belongings and heading for the door. As you are about to step outside another pilgrim that has been staying at the same inn comes down the stairs and spots you, and she quickly calls you out on leaving an inn during the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_92;I can't please everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_93;You head down to the common room and eat a quick breakfast before gathering your belongings and setting off from the inn. You have quite far to travel before you reach your destination, and you cannot affort to waste time, and since nobody seems to have noticed that you are breaking the rules it probably will not be anything you come to regret.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_93;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_94;You decide that you should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of you. You spend the time reflecting on the fact that there are many things in life that you cannot control, and that that sometimes mean you have to wait on things, and you resolve to be a bit more patient moving forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_94;Good things come to those that wait!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_95;You decide that you should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of you. As you don't really have anything to do you the time is not spent in a productive manner, but you find that you don't mind this as much as you had expected, and you decide that perhaps it would not be a bad idea to take it easy more often.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_95;I should not work so hard...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_96;You decide that you should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of you. You don't bother trying to be productive, and even though you initially planned to leave at dawn you find yourself lingering at the inn for a while longer after that, since you have come to feel that there really is no need to rush.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_96;I can relax more often...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_97;You decide that you should remain at the inn until dawn, as is expected of you. As you hear the other people that have stayed overnight start moving about you head down to eat a quick breakfast, and as the sun is above the horizon after you are done you gather your belongings and set off, seeing as you no longer risk breaking the rules.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_97;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SHINTO_99;The Chrysanthemum Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_99;After a long journey you have finally arrived at the destination for your pilgrimage: The court of the [the_tenno.GetTitle].\n\nThough you have not yet entered the august presence of [the_tenno.GetBestName] {the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself] and thus have not beheld the actual Chrysanthemum Throne, you still feel a sense of awe as the place is quite magnificient, and judging by the looks on the faces of the other pilgrims you have seen you are not the only one that is impressed.\n\nAside from briefly being stopped by the guards so that they could confirm who you were, none of the locals have really paid attention to you yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_99;I need to be on my best behavior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_100;You could spend weeks or even months wandering the court of the [the_tenno.GetTitle] without getting to see [the_tenno.GetHerHim] or the Chrysanthemum Throne itself, and none would fault you for not bothering [the_tenno.GetHerHim], but you have travelled far and are not just any common pilgrim, so perhaps it would be possible to get an audience if you merely asked for one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_100;I will try to get an audience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_100;I'd rather not bother [the_tenno.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_101;One of the lesser court officials informs you that [From.GetBestName] has arrived at your court on a pilgrimage and that [From.GetSheHe] is requesting an audience with you. It is unclear if there is a particular reason for this audience or not, and it is not out of line to ask for an audience, but it is up to you if you want to accept the request or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_101;I don't have time for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_101;I can spare the time;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_101;We can meet... in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_102;A messenger arrives to inform you that the [the_tenno.GetTitle] is busy with affairs of state for the time being and cannot spare the time to grant you the audience you seek. The messenger further suggests that it is in everyone's interests for you not to try again later, as the [the_tenno.GetBestName] does not enjoy repeating [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_102;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_103;A messenger arrives to inform you that the [the_tenno.GetTitle] has seen fit to grant you the audience you seek. As [the_tenno.GetSheHe] is a bit busy at the moment and was taken by surprise by the request, you will have to wait a short while, but you had not expected [the_tenno.GetBestName] to have time right away, so this does not really bother you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_103;That's good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_104;A messenger arrives to inform you that the [the_tenno.GetTitle] has seen fit to grant you the audience you seek. He tells you to follow him, and as you do so a number of guards fall in all around you. You don't pay much attention to them or where you are going before you notice that you are leaving the central part of the palace, and you soon discover what is happening as you are tossed into an empty cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_104;It was a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_105;You are led into the august presence of [the_tenno.GetBestName] [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself] without much delay. Knowing what is expected of you, you quickly drop to your knees in front of [the_tenno.GetHerHim}, but [the_tenno.GetSheHe] quickly tells you to rise and asks if there was anything in particular you wanted to discuss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_105;I am here to express my appreciation!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_105;I ask for your blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_105;I just wanted to talk to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_106;You inform the [the_tenno.GetBestName] that you merely wished to express your appreciation for [the_tenno.GetHerHis] rule and [the_tenno.GetHerHim] in general and preferred to do so in person rather than through a message, as it is easier to make it clear that you are being sincere if you are there in person. [the_tenno.GetBestName] considers your words for a moment and then tells you that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] appreciates them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_106;I think that went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_107;[From.GetBestName] appears before you and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and you bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] is there to express [From.GetHerHis] appreciation of you and your rule, and as best you can tell [From.GetSheHe] is being sincere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_107;I am rather great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_108;[From.GetBestName] appears before you and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and you bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] is there to ask for your blessing, and that of the kami, on [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetHerHis] rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_108;A blessing? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_108;A blessing? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_109;[the_tenno.GetBestName] considers your request for a moment before telling you that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] and the kami look favorably on you and your rule and that you definitely are worthy of their blessing. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] further tells you that the fact that you saw fit to ask speaks highly of you, as just assuming that you had their approval would be unseemly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_109;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_110;[the_tenno.GetBestName] considers your request for a moment before telling you that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] and the kami do not look favorably on you and your rule and that you definitely are unworthy of their blessing. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] further tells you that you will need to work quite hard if you are to ever prove yourself worthy of such an honor, as there are many resons to disapprove of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_110;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_111;You tell [the_tenno.GetBestName] that you wished to converse with [the_tenno.GetHerHim] on anything that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] might want to talk about as you feel that the two of you might get along. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] is a bit surprised, but after you have been conversing for a while [the_tenno.GetSheHe] tells you that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] has been enjoying your conversation and look forward to speaking again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_111;We both had a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_112;[From.GetBestName] appears before you and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and you bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] wished to talk to you for a bit to see if you might get along, and after you have been conversing for a while it is clear that you agree about many things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_112;We both had a good time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_113;You tell [the_tenno.GetBestName] that you wished to converse with [the_tenno.GetHerHim] on anything that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] might want to talk about as you feel that the two of you might get along. [the_tenno.GetSheHeCap] is a bit surprised, and after you have been conversing for a while [the_tenno.GetSheHe] tells you that [the_tenno.GetSheHe] has better things to do than to listen to your nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_113;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_114;[From.GetBestName] appears before you and falls to [From.GetHerHis] knees, as would be expected, and you bid [From.GetHerHim] to rise and inquire as to why [From.GetSheHe] asked for an audience. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] wished to talk to you for a bit to see if you might get along, but though you humor the request it quickly becomes clear that [From.GetSheHe] is poor company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_114;Leave my presence at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_116;You have been spending some time walking around and talking to both other pilgrims and various officials at the court of the [the_tenno.GetBestName], and you feel certain that as long as you keep your faith in the kami and work together you will be able to achieve anything, as any doubts that you once might have felt have been dispersed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_116;My faith has never been stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_117;You have been spending some time walking around and talking to both other pilgrims and various officials at the court of the [the_tenno.GetBestName]. When you arrived, you thought that everyone here would be devout, but it has become clear that that is not the case, and if those near the Chrysanthemum Throne itself see no reason to put their faith in the kami it does not speak highly of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_117;It is all meaningless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_118;As you are walking around the palace of [the_tenno.GetBestName] you suddenly get a flash of inspiration and know that you have a message you must share with those around you. It might not be something that the peopel there will like to hear, but the words in your mind cannot be stopped, and they must be shared with those that do not yet know of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_118;THE KAMI SPEAK TO ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_119;A servant comes hurrying into your presence, ignoring proper protocol as she immediately begins talking to you. Listening to her words, it is clear that this is justifiable, as she brings word that [From.GetBestName] apparently is screaming out words that supposedly are coming directly from the kami at the top of [From.GetHerHis] voice, words that are rather questionable..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_119;We must imprison this mad[From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_119;We must [From.GetHerHim] away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_119;Let's just ignore it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SHINTO_119;THE KAMI SPEAK TO [From.GetHerHimFullCaps]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HIMCAPS;HIM;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HERCAPS;HER;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_120;You are not really paying attention to your surroundings as you are sharing the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to you, and thus you fail to notice the arrival of a group of guards before they ae upon you. They quickly grab you and drag you away, and it is not long before you are tossed into an empty cell somewhere beneath the palace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_120;The kami never mentioned this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_121;You are not really paying attention to your surroundings as you are sharing the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to you, and thus you fail to notice the arrival of a group of guards before they ae upon you. They quickly grab you and drag you away, and it is not long before they have brought you to the outskirts of the palace, upon which they give you a shove to send you on your way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_121;But I spoke the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_122;You speak at length, sharing the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to you with all nearby. Nobody really seems to be paying attention to you, however, and eventually you are forced to conclude that your words have fallen on deaf ears and that you probably would be better of sharing the truth elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_122;YOU CAN'T IGNORE ME FOREVER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_123;You speak at length, sharing the glorious truths that the kami have revealed to you with all nearby. At first, people are skeptical, but then a messenger appears to inform those present that [the_tenno.GetBestName] [the_tenno.GetHerselfHimself] bids everyone to listen to you and your glorious truths. After that, the crowd pays attention to everything you tell them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_123;I SPEAK THE TRUTH!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_124;You have spent some time at the court of [the_tenno.GetBestName] and have met many people, among them [pilgrims_friend.GetBestName], a most interesting [pilgrims_friend.GetManWoman]. The two of you have a lot in common, and you feel confident that you will find reason to meet in the future as you both have been enjoying each other's company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_124;I have a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_125;You have spent some time at the court of [the_tenno.GetBestName] and have met many people, among them [pilgrims_rival.GetBestName], a most irksome [pilgrims_rival.GetManWoman]. [pilgrims_rival.GetSheHeCap] has made it clear that your presence is unwelcome this close to the Chrysanthemum Throne, and that [pilgrims_rival.GetSheHe] also finds you generally disagreeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_125;I must be on my guard against [pilgrims_rival.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_126;Though you doubtlessly could spend more time at the court of the [the_tenno.GetBestName], you have been away from home for quite a while, and doubtlessly there are things that will require your time once you return, so it is time to begin the journey back to [Root.Capital.GetName] without further delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_126;I must head home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SHINTO_127;The Kumano Route;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_127;You have arrived at the start of the Kumano pilgrim route, along which a number of important shrines can be found, and though you've decided not to visit the grand shrine at Ise this time you will definitely visit quite a few shrines.\n\nYou have already noticed that there are plenty of other pilgrims around, so you will likely have some company on the road from time to time, and perhaps you might come across some noteworthy people.\n\nRegardless of who or what you might find along the pilgrim route, you must be prepared to keep on walking, unlike what would be the case at many other destinations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_127;I still have far to walk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_128;After visiting a few of the shrines along the Kumano route you notice that the number of pilgrims on the road is much smaller than it was closer to the start of the route. Evidently, not everyone bothers to visit every shrine around the pilgrim route, and you start to wonder if you perhaps should cut the pilgrimage short as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_128;I can stop now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_128;I can't stop early!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_129;You decide to skip as many shrines as you can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that you can make good use of. Over the next few days, you start feeling that you made the right decision, and decide that working hard is not right for you after all. From now on, you want to take it easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_129;I should take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_130;You decide to skip as many shrines as you can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that you can make good use of. You spend the next couple of days reflecting on how much you tend to work, and you conclude that you really should learn to relax more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_130;I can't work all the time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_131;You decide to skip as many shrines as you can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that you can make good use of. As you walk along the much shorter route you decide that you have made the right choice, as you really do not feel that there is much to be gained from faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_131;Faith has its limits...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_132;You decide to skip as many shrines as you can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that you can make good use of. You have not really considered yourself a strong believer in the Shinto faith at any point, and when you consider things a bit more you conclude that it simply is not important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_132;The kami are irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_133;You decide to skip as many shrines as you can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that you can make good use of. A few hours later, when your path briefly intersects with the actual pilgrim route, you come face to face with a priestess who sees fit to berate you for not taking the proper route.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_133;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_134;You decide to skip as many shrines as you can get away with and take a look at a map, noticing that there are various possible shortcuts that you can make good use of. The journey is largely uneventful, and you feel that it was the right decision to take the shorter route as nobody seems to mind that you did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_134;I knew I could stop early!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_135;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. As you do, you consider various times in the past when you have been less diligent and how you often have ended up regretting this, and you resolve to improve in that regard in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_135;Hard work pays off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_136;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. You reflect on the fact that you in the past would have chosen the easier route as that would have required less effort on your part, and you decide that those days are behind you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_136;I can't afford to rest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_137;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. Once, you would have found doing such a thing quite wasteful, as you was unsure whether the kami were real or not, but over the course of your journey you have reconsidered those opinions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_137;I no longer lack faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_138;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. You have always had faith in the kami and the teachings of the Shinto faith, and as you visit the shrines and listen to the priests and priestesses there your faith only becomes stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_138;My faith has never been stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_139;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. Once, you would have found such a journey rather difficult, but the long journey to the start of the Kumano route and the journey along the route has made you stronger than you once were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_139;I am not so weak now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_140;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. Though you have never been what you would consider weak, you are noticing that you feel less and less tired at the end of every day. Evidently, the journey has paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_140;I feel stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_141;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. At one of these shrines, you come across a priestess that fancies herself a scholar on both religious and mundane matters, and she is more than willing to share a few insights with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_141;This will be useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_142;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. The priests and priestesses found there are quite pleased to learn that you have not skipped any of the shrines, and they tell you that it is most definitely something that puts you apart from many pilgrims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_142;I did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_143;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. Along the rouad, you come across an old warrior who offers to teach you some of what he knows so that you know how to defend yourself if you should happen to be beset by bandits or the like, and you see no reason to refuse such a generous offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_143;He was most helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_144;You decide against ending the pilgrimage early and continue along the main route, spending some time at every shrine you come across. The journey is largely uneventful, and though it is not over quickly you do not really regret spending more time on your pilgrimage as the route you followed was quite scenic at times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_144;It has been enjoyable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_145;As you reach the end of the Kumano route you know that it is time for you to head home. Even though there are things you could do away from home that might be of interest, there is doubtlessly a lot of work waiting for you back at [Root.Capital.GetName], and it woudl be good to deal with it sooner rather than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_145;I must head home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SHINTO_146;Ise Grand Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_146;At last you have arrived at Ise, the site of a massive shrine complex primarily dedicated to Amaterasu-omikami, the great august kami who shines in the heaven. It is one of the holiest and most important sites of the Shinto religion, and you are not surprised to see that you are not the only pilgrim that has come there at this time.\n\nThough parts of the shrine complex are not open to most pilgrims, you are confident that you are important enough to be permitted to visit nearly any location of importance, and even if you were to discover that some areas are off limits to you there is a lot to see, so your visit to Ise unlikely to be a brief one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_146;Praise the Sun Goddess!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_147;As you are walking around near the main shrine at Ise a young priestess approaches you to inform you that the Saio, who the head priestess of Ise and a member of the Imperial Family, has heard of your arrival and wishes to speak with you, if you can find the time. You are free to refuse, of course, but it would probably upset the Saio, and therefore possibly upset Amaterasu herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_147;I will meet with her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_147;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_148;The Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], looks pleased when you are led into her presence, and she welcomes you to Ise in both her own name and the name of Amaterasu. She indicates that she has set aside some time for you, and it is clear from the way she phrases it that it is up to you what you want to attempt to accomplish during this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_148;I want to seduce her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_148;I want to befriend her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_148;I want Amaterasu's blessing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_149;During your meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, you graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can choose what the two of you will be talking about once the initial pleasantries are over. To your surprise, [From.GetBestName] suggests that [From.GetSheHe] and you should stop talking and should go somewhere more private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_149;Oh, that sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_149;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_149;Me and you? NEVER!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_150;The Saio, [From.GetBestName], is quite receptive to your attempt to seduce her, and since she is in charge of Ise it is not a problem for her to ensure that the two of you are left alone so that you can get to know one another much more intimately. As she is supposed to remain celibate while at the shrine, it would look bad if word of what just happened got out, but you don't see any real reason to worry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_150;THat went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_151;A messenger arrived from Ise today, bringing a letter from one of the lesser priestesses there. According to this letter, the Saio, [From.GetBestName], your [From.GetRelation] and the head priestess of Ise, is not as celibate as she is supposed to be. Though the letter does not provide any proof, it is doubtful that the priestess is lying, and it is only a matter of time before word gets out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_151;The Saio has shamed us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_152;Some days after [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s visit you start hearing rumors regarding the fact that you have broken your vow of celibacy. It is unknown who started the rumors, and they do not seem to contain any mention of the identity of your new lover, but it is probably only a matter of time before [From.GetBestName] learns of what happened and takes issue with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_152;I should have been more discreet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_153;The Saio is displeased by your attempt at seduction and tells you in no uncertain terms that she will not betray her vow of celibacy. She suggests that you should leave her presence at once, and that you should reconsider your behavior, as Amaterasu does not look kindly on pilgrims that behave improperly during a pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_153;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_154;The Saio is displeased by your attempt at seduction and tells you in no uncertain terms that she will not betray her vow of celibacy. She further informs you that she would not consider sleeping with you even if she had not made any such vow, and that you have most definitely overstayed your welcome, and orders you to leave her presence at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_154;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_155;You tell the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], that you wish to get to know her better, and she is willing to converse with you on a number of different subjects in order to make that possible. It turns out that the two of you have a lot in common, and that you enjoy each other's company, and by the time she needs to attend to other business it is clear that you have made a friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_155;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_156;During your meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, you graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can choose what the two of you will be talking about once the initial pleasantries are over. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that [From.GetSheHe] would like to get to know you better, and it turns out the two of you have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_156;Best friends forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_157;You tell the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], that you wish to get to know her better, and she is willing to converse with you on a number of different subjects in order to make that possible. Unfortunate, it turns out that the two of you have nothing in common, and that you despise each other's company, and she quickly orders you to leave her presence..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_157;That didn't go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_158;During your meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, you graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can choose what the two of you will be talking about once the initial pleasantries are over. [From.GetSheHeCap] says that [From.GetSheHe] would like to get to know you better, but it quickly becomes clear that [From.GetSheHe] is a most disagreeable person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_158;I don't like [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_159;During your meeting with [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim that has come to the Ise Grand Shrine, you graciously tell [From.GetHerHim] that [From.GetSheHe] can choose what the two of you will be talking about once the initial pleasantries are over. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] wishes for you to bless [From.GetHerHim] in the name of Amaterasu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_159;A blessing? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_159;A blessing? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_160;You ask the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], to bless you in the name of Amaterasu, and after considering your request for a brief moment she tells you that it is not unreasonable and that you shall have your blessing. The two of you converse a while longer, but eventually she needs to attend to other matters and has to ask you to depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_160;I got what I wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_161;You ask the Saio, [the_saio.GetBestName], to bless you in the name of Amaterasu, and after considering your request for a brief moment she tells you that it is unreasonable and that you shall not have your blessing. You suggest that perhaps the two of you could converse a while longer, as you feel that perhaps you could change her mind, but she asks you to leave her presence at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_161;That didn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_163;You have encountered many other pilgrims at the Ise Grand Shrine and many priests and priestesses serving both Amaterasu-omikami herself and various other kami too, and this has made you reflect on the Shinto faith. Once, you might have had your doubts, but those days are behind you, as you feel that the pilgrimage only has made your faith stronger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_163;Amaterasu watches over us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_164;You have encountered many other pilgrims at the Ise Grand Shrine and many priests and priestesses serving both Amaterasu-omikami herself and various other kami too, and this has made you reflect on the Shinto faith. Once, you might have had faith in the kami, but those days are behind you, as you feel that the pilgrimage only has made your faith weaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_164;Amaterasu is nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_165;AS you are walking around outside the main shrine at Ise you feel a sudden flash of inspiration, and many glorious truths are at once clear to you. You need to share these truths with those around you, and you feel that writing down the message on the walls of the shrine is the best way to accomplish this, even though many of the onlookers try to dissuade you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_165;AMATERASU SPEAKS TO ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_166;A young priestess comes running into your presence to inform you that [From.GetBestName], a pilgrim visiting Ise, has started writing down various unholy messages on the walls of the shrine, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] is revealing truths that come directly from Amaterasu herself. The priestess asks what you want to do about the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_166;Imprison this mad[From.GetManWoman]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_166;Get [From.GetHerHim] out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_166;Just have someone clean it up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SHINTO_166;AMATERASU SPEAKS TO [From.GetHerHimFullCaps]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_167;You are in the middle of writing down the glorious truths Amaterasu have revealed to you and fail to pay attention to your surroundings, which means you do not notice the guards before they are upon you. They seize you and drag you away, ignoring your demands to be released, and before long they have dragged you into a cell and locked you inside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_167;Amaterasu didn't mention this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_168;You are in the middle of writing down the glorious truths Amaterasu have revealed to you and fail to pay attention to your surroundings, which means you do not notice the guards before they are upon you. They seize you and drag you away, ignoring your demands to be released, and before long they have dragged you to the outskirts of Ise and told you to go away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_168;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_169;You finish writing your most holy message from Amaterasu on the walls of the shrine and move away from it, satisfied with your work. As you leave, you notice that a number of priests and priestesses come running and start cleaning away the words that you wrote. You see no reason to rewrite them at this time, as you can share your message elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_169;THE TRUTH WILL NOT BE CONCEALED!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_170;The crowd surrounding you goes silent as a young priestess comes running, and though you initially think that she is there to try to stop you from sharing the glorious truths that Amaterasu revealed to you it turns out that she has brought a message from the Saio that tells the crowd to heed your words as they clearly come from Amaterasu herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_170;AMATERASU SPEAKS TO ME!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_171;Your visit to Ise has been rather pleasant, and you are not sure that you have seen everything of note there, but it is time for you to take your leave. Doubtlessly, there are many things back at [Root.Capital.GetName] that require your attention already, and delaying your return would therefore be rather unwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_171;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SHINTO_172;The Holy Mountain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_172;For some time now, the iconic shape of Mount Fuji, your destination and one of the Three Holy Mountains, has been visible at the horizon, steadily growing larger, and now you have finally arrived at its base.\n\nYou can see plenty of other pilgrims around, as well as priests and priestesses that doubtlessly are charged with maintaining the many Shinto shrines surrounding the mountain. They all appear to be absorbed in their own thoughts at the moment, and pay you little attention.\n\nWhile you knew some of what to expect from the many depictions of the mountain that you have seen in the past, it is definitely a sight worth seeing in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_172;It is quite impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_173;There are several pilgrim routes circling Mount Fuji, and also a number that appear to permit you to ascend all the way to the summit. Though the journey to the summit might be difficult, and perhaps even somewhat dangerous, people would likely think more highly if you if you ascended the mountain, but it is ultimately up to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_173;I must climb the mountain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_173;I can stay here...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_174;You travel up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Partway up the side of the mountain, you accidentally cause a small rockslide, and though you manage to avoid the worst of it some of the rocks still strike you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_174;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_175;You travel up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. However, you press on, and eventually find the going easier and easier despite the route not becoming more forgiving. It seems your pilgrimage has paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_175;I am not so weak now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_176;You travel up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Pressing on, you find strength within that you did not think you had, and the going becomes more and more manageable even though the route hardly becomes more forgiving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_176;I feel stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_177;You travel up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Once, the prospect of such a climb would have been too daunting to contemplate, but you are a changed [Root.GetManWoman] as a result of your pilgrimage, and you press on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_177;I can't afford to relax!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_178;You travel up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. You are no stranger to having to work hard to achieve what you want to achieve, however, and you refuse to consider giving up on the climb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_178;I must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_179;You travel up along one of the pilgrim routes leading to the summit of Mount Fuji, finding the going rather difficult as the path is both narrow and steep in several places. Even so, the journey is not entirely unpleasant, and it is also rather uneventful, and though it takes a while you make good progress towards the summit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_179;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_181;It takes you some time, but eventually you manage to ascend all the way to the summit of Mount Fuji. The view from the mountain is quite nice, and you feel that you never would have gotten to see it if you had not put your faith in the Shinto religion and the kami, seeing as you never would have made a pilgrimage if that wasn't the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_181;My faith is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_182;It takes you some time, but eventually you manage to ascend all the way to the summit of Mount Fuji. The journey has been exhausting, and you do not find the view to be as pleasant as you had been led to believe, and given how disappointing it has been you start to wonder whether the whole pilgrimage has been a waste of your time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_182;I had expected far more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_183;It takes you some time, but eventually you manage to ascend all the way to the summit of Mount Fuji. Looking down on the land below, you do not feel that the experience has brought you closer to the kami or has given you any more insights into the Shinto faith, but you cannot deny that the climb still was worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_183;The view is quite good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_185;You decide to head along one of the less travelled pilgrimage routes circling Mount Fuji and make sure to stop at the shrines you come across to pay your respect to the kami there. The priests and priestesses tending to the shrines are quite welcoming, and they make you feel rather more confident about the teachings of the Shinto faith with their words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_185;My faith is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_186;You decide to head along one of the less travelled pilgrimage routes circling Mount Fuji and make sure to stop at the shrines you come across to pay your respect to the kami there. Several of the priests and priestesses there express their disappointment in the fact that you decided not to climb the mountain, and you had expected far better from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_186;This was a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_187;You decide to head along one of the less travelled pilgrimage routes circling Mount Fuji and make sure to stop at the shrines you come across to pay your respect to the kami there. You speak a little with some of the other pilgrims you come across, and hear a few interestingt things, but on the whole it is an uneventful experience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_187;I guess it was a nice walk...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_189;After another pilgrim mentions that there is a short pilgrimage route leading through a forest to the northwest of Mount Fuji you decide that you will take a short walk along this route before returning home. As you wander through this forest you feel something brush right past you, and though you cannot see anything you suddenly remember that the pilgrim warned you that the part might be haunted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_189;Was that a ghost?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_190;You sometimes get flashes of insight that others do not get, and as you are preparing to leave Mount Fuji you get the feeling that you must walk to the northwest. You do, entering the forest found there, and wondering what you might find. Suddently, yet another insight comes to you, and you realize that the spirits of the dead are everywhere around you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_190;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_191;You decide to take a walk along a pilgrimage route leading to the northwest from Mount Fuji because the forest you can see in that direction looks quite strange. Entering the forest, you feel something strange in the air all around you, and before long you can see the spirits of the dead appear in every direction, watching your every move with interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_191;Get away from me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_192;Having seen some pilgrims head off along a pilgrimage route leading into a forest on the northwestern side of Mount Fuji you decide to head in that direction as well. Some distance into the forest you come across a man sitting with his knees folded and a sword in his hand, and it appears as if he is about to use it on himself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_192;I'll try to stop him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_192;I'll egg him on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_193;You call out to the man, telling him that he likely has much to live for and that whatever honor he might feel that he has lost is something he could regain in life. He hesitates for a few moments but then puts away the sword and rises to his feet, giving you a bow and telling you that he really needed to hear that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_193;Happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_194;You call out to the man, telling him that he likely has much to live for and that whatever honor he might feel that he has lost is something he could regain in life. The man calls you a fool for not believing in the righteousness of seppuku, and you have no time to react before the man takes his own life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_194;Oh, no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_195;Though the journey to Mount Fuji has had a few pleasant moments, you still do not feel like things are going your way, and as you are walking along a pilgrimage route leading to the northwest from the sacred mountain you consider whether it actually is worth returning from your pilgrimage, seeing as your life is unlikely to get better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_195;This is the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_195;I will keep on living...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_196;You resolve to keep on living, and as you keep walking through the forest you reflect on your life and the people around you. There have been bad times, for sure, but now that you think about it there have also been good times, and though things might be difficult at times you resolve to press on and try to look on the bright side of things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_196;I have things to live for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_197;You resolve to keep on living, and as you keep walking through the forest you reflect on your life and the people around you. Though you try to look for good things that have happened to you, they are rather few, and the same goes for having enjoyable company. Still, you have made your choice, and perhaps you will not come to regret it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_197;Let's hope things improve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_198;Though you could have elected to head home once you finished with the pilgrimage routes at the sacred mountain itself you decide to spend some more time nearby and take off along a route leading off to the northwest, passing through a thick forest. The journey is uneventful, but you do not feel that you made the right choice even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_198;It was a pleasant walk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_199;It is time to leave Mount Fuji behind and return home, as you cannot avoid your responsibilities back at [Root.Capital.GetName] forever, and even though you left instructions for how to manage your realm in your absence there likely are things that will require your personal attention even if everything was done exactly as you ordered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_199;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SHINTO_200;The Shrines of Shikoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_200;You have finally arrived in Shikoku, where the many shrines you will visit during your pilgrimage are located.\n\nUnlike most other pilgrimages, which tend to involve visiting one or a few holy sites located closely together, the Shikoku pilgrimage involves walking around the whole island, following a symbolic path to enlightenment. As such, you will not be spending a lot of time at any one shrine.\n\nYou intend to spend the rest of the day taking care of the final preparations before the journey, followed by a meal and a good night's sleep, as you know you have far to walk over the coming weeks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_200;The long walk begins tomorrow...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_202;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. You consider the matter as you visit the shrines one after the other, but so far you are not sure what you really are supposed to be feeling, and you suppose that you will have to wait and see. At least the weather has been nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_202;At least it hasn't been raining...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_203;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. You consider the matter as you visit the shrines one after the other, and though you are not entirely convinced that you have grasped the essence of what you are supposed to understand you are willing to make an effort to become more enlightened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_203;I am willing to learn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_204;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. You consider the matter as you visit the shrines one after the other, and listening to the priests tending to these shrines gives you a better idea of what the Buddhist faith is all about, and this knowledge fills you with confidence that it is the one and only true faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_204;In faith I find strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_205;The first part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of awakening. You consider the matter as you visit the shrines one after the other, but you really have a hard time seeing how it is relevant, and the priests tending to the shrines are most unhelpful when you seek their guidance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_205;This is pointless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_206;As you keep moving from shrine to shrine you occasionally come across other pilgrims, and you have overheard a few of them considering the idea of taking a shortcut from the eastern side of Shikoku to the western side and thus skipping to the end of the pilgrimage. It is certainly not what you are supposed to do, but since the route is rather long it might be tempting to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_206;I will also skip to the end!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_206;I must follow the true path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_207;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Partway across the island you meet a wandering priest, who berates you for not following the true path, stating that this is not in line with the Buddha's teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_207;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_208;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Normally, the prospect of working hard to reach a goal would not have bothered you, but you have started to realize that you spend too much time working for too little gain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_208;Work is boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_209;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. As you move along this shorter route you start to consider the fact that it often would be possible to take other shortcuts in life, and you decide that you will do that from now on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_209;I should take it more easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_210;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Despite taking it easy, you feel that the going is hard, perhaps because you have been taking it easy rather than worrying about staying in shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_210;Strength isn't everything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_211;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. You have never been particularly strong, and even though taking it easy during your journey you find that it is difficult at times, suggesting you are weaker than you previously thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_211;This is not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_212;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Once, the idea of not doing what the teachings of the Buddhist religion said would have been unthinkable, but you have come to realize that you don't care as much about that as you previously thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_212;I was boring before...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_213;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Your faith has never been particularly strong, and you find yourself questioning it more and more as you keep walking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_213;The Buddha was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_214;You decide that following the actual path pilgrims are supposed to take will take up far too much of your time, and consequently you decide that it is reasonable to take a shortcut to the end of the route. Though the route might be less scenic than the true pilgrimage, you feel that the time you save is well worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_214;I made the right choice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_216;You keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines.

EVTDESC_SHINTO_234;You keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines.

EVTOPTA_SHINTO_234;The Buddha was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_235;You keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines. This part of the route is dedicated to the concept of discipline, but though you try to determine how you could better yourself you find it hard to determine how you could do this. Still, you suppose that you have made more of an effort than many others have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_235;I could have done worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_236;You keep walking along the true pilgrimage route and reach the second set of shrines.

EVTOPTA_SHINTO_236;I know the value of discipline!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_238;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine. As a result of your conversations with the priests at those shrines, you start to realize that you know more than you once thought you did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_238;I am smarter now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_239;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine.

EVTOPTA_SHINTO_239;I am smarter now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_240;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine. The priests at the shrines are quite willing to converse with you about various matters of faith to help you on your path, and you learn quite a few new things from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_240;I learned a few things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_241;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine. As best you can tell, you do not become more enlightened as you continue along the path, but perhaps enlightenment is something that takes a while to notice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_241;Well, that didn't do anything...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_242;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine. As you keep walking, you realize just how important it is to seek knowledge, as well as just how much knowledge there is to be found in various holy texts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_242;My faith is strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_243;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine. However, while you get enlightened in a way, the main thing that you realize is that the Buddhist religion really is not all it claims to be, and that faith is not a path to true knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_243;Faith is futile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_244;The third part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of enlightenment, which is something that you contemplate as you move from shrine to shrine. Some of the other pilgrims are really struggling with this, and you do what you can to help them on their path to enlightenment, which they thank you for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_244;Happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_246;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. You consider this matter as you continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. The more you hear about the concept, the less appealing it sounds to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_246;This has been a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_247;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. You consider this matter as you continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. Though you are uncertain whether you will be worthy of nirvana in this life, you resolve to strive for it every day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_247;My faith has never been stronger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_248;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. You start to consider whether you already are worthy, seeing as you are true to the teachings of the Buddhist faith and get enlightened insights all the time, and wonder whether the only thing holding you back is the fact that you are alive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_248;Nirvana awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_248;Nirvana can wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_249;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. You consider this matter as you continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. You are not quite sure you understand the concept of nirvana any better now than you did before your pilgrimage, but maybe you will think differently in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_249;At least the journey has been pleasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_250;The final part of the Shikoku pilgrimage is dedicated to the concept of nirvana, the release from the cycle of death and rebirth. You consider this matter as you continue from shrine to shrine, taking to the priests tending to them. The priests tell you some things that help you understand the concept better, but you are unsure if you truly understand it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_250;I am willing to learn more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_251;You have finally reached the end of the Shikoku pilgrimage route, and it is time for you to head back to [Root.Capital.GetBestName] to attend to various matters that might require your attention at home. Hopefully, the return journey will be both uneventful and quick, as you do not wish for delays or unwelcome surprises.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_251;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SHINTO_252;A Visit to Mount Koya;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_252;After a long journey you have arrived at Mount Koya. The sacred monastery here is located between the mountain's eight peaks, making it appear almost as if it is situated in a lotus plant, and even at a distance it is impressive.\n\nYou can see many lesser shrines surrounding the monastery, which perhaps might be of interest to visit, and there are plenty of other monks and pilgrims in attendance as well, so you are hardly the only one that has chosen to head there.\n\nThough the whole area is sacred and many of the people here might be interesting to talk to, the sheer size of the place might make it hard for you to find anything in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_252;Let's take a look around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_254;The monks at Mount Koya are pleased to learn that you have an education focused on religion. When they learn that your education is a bit less extensive than they would have assumed, they immediately offer to help you learn more, and despite not being able to spend much time with them it still has a positive effect as you feel that you understand various things much better now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_254;I have learned much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_255;After talking to some of the monks at Mount Koya you learn a few new things. Most of them have to do with the Buddhist faith, which is unsurprising considering where you are and who you were talking to, but you can also seee ways to perhaps apply that knowledge to other things, and returning from your pilgrimage with more knowledge seems good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_255;I learned a few things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_256;There are many learned men at Mount Koya. Though most of them are monks and thus have dedicated themselves to the Buddhist faith more thoroughly than you plan to do, there are also some others present that are quite learned. Having spoken to some of these people, you start to wonder if you perhaps should dedicate yourself to seeking knowledge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_256;I will be a Scholar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_256;Theology feels right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SHINTO_256;I shall be a Mystic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SHINTO_256;I want to do other things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_257;The various holy places at Mount Koya truly are a sight to behold, and the people there are quite friendly and clearly work to better themselves and to helping their fellow Buddhists. You are quite satisfied with what you have seen, and resolve to dedicate yourself more fully to your faith from now on, as it is clear that it is the one and only true way to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_257;Praise the Buddha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_258;Though the various shrines at Mount Koya looked impressive at first, they get less impressive as you visit them, and both the monks and the other pilgrims are most unhelpful. You suspect that the former might be telling the truth when they claim to follow the teachings of the Buddha, but if that is the case then you doubt that there is any enlightenement to be found down that path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_258;The Buddha was wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_259;Though Mount Koya primarily is a Buddhist holy site, there are also some shrines in the area that are dedicated to the kami, and thus you have come across a few Shinto pilgrims and priestesses as well. Though they do not make an effort to convince you that the Shinto faith is superior to the Buddhist faith, they seem friendly enough, and perhaps conversion might be appealing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_259;Praise the kami!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_259;I will not betray my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_260;As you speak to the monks at Mount Koya you start to consider the idea of celibacy. It is certainly not a requirement for anyone to live a celibate life if they are not a monk or a nun, but it might help you further along the path to enlightenment even so, and perhaps it is something that might be of interest as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_260;Celibacy feels right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHINTO_260;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_261;You speak to several of the pilgrims at Mount Koya, inquiring about who they are and you they are there. Many of them are rather uninteresting people, all things considered, but one of them turns out to be a young warrior of some renown, and he offers to teach you a few things, free of charge. You see no reason to turn down such a kind offer, and the lesson goes quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_261;He was a good teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_262;You spend a little time visiting the shrines at Mount Koya and speaking to the people found there, but there is not a whole lot of interest to be found there, and you resolve to take a walk along the nearby pilgrim route instead. It is certainly pleasant enough, though as you have been walking quite far on your way to Mount Koya it does not feel all that different from the journey there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_262;I guess it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_263;Though there might be more to see at Moutn Koya, you have spent some time there now and it would be prudent to head home. The journey is quite far, after all, and once you get back to [Root.Capital.GetName] it is quite likely that you will find out that there is work to do, and the amount of work would probably increase if you stayed away for a longer time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_263;Time to go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_265;After a long but uneventful journey home you finally arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The pilgrimage you went on was quite pleasant, all things considered, and though it took some time you do not regret it. Perhaps you will even decide to set out on another pilgrimage in the future, as there are more places to visit and more to discover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_265;A jorney to remember!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_266;After a long but uneventful journey home you finally arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Though there were a few pleasant moments during the pilgrimage, you feel that it overall was a letdown, and your faith in the teachings of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is nowhere near as strong as it once was. You doubt you will ever consider another pilgrimage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_266;That was a waste of time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHINTO_267;After a long but uneventful journey home you finally arrive in [Root.Capital.GetName]. The kami have been silent since the unpleasant welcome your revelation received, and though your faith in them remains unshaken you are certain you have failed them in a way. Perhaps you will give it another attempt in the future, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHINTO_267;A journey to forget!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
