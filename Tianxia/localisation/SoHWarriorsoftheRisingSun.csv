EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_32B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt displeases me and all other Warriors of the Rising Sun that you have failed to defeat your hated rival in a War of Honor.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_36;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI write to you to request that you agree to serve as my mentor in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun so that I may prove myself worthy and may ascend to a higher rank.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_37;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_38;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI might be prepared to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun as you ask, but before I can tell if I am prepared to do that you will have to show me how well you fight.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_38;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_38;I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_39;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am a busy [From.GetManWoman] and am uncertain as to whether I would be able to find the time to mentor you. A small amount of gold would make it easier for me to find the time...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_39;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_39;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_40;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI can see why you would want me to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I might be willing to do you that favor, but in that case I would ask a favor in return...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_40;Sure, I'll owe you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_40;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_41;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou may have been allowed to join the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, but that does not entitle you to my guidance. Find another mentor, for I dont see any reason to mentor you.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_41;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_42;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. In your experience, new members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are generally somewhat lacking in skill regardless of their background, but [From.GetBestName] is possibly more skilled than you are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_42;I will suggest a better mentor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_42;I will mentor them, even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_42;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_43;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. While you notice some areas where [From.GetSheHe] might be lacking, these flaws are rather minor, and you must admit that those that taught [From.GetBestName] to fight did a very good job that you cannot improve upon very much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_43;I will mentor them, even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_43;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_44;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. You notice some flaws, but also some strengths, and in your opinion [From.GetBestName] is about as skilled as the average new member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun is expected to be. You could certainly help [From.GetHerHim] improve a little.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_44;I will teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_44;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_45;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. You notice a few promising areas, but on the whole [From.GetSheHe] is a rather poor warrior, and it would likely take quite some work to help [From.GetHerHim] improve to the point where they would perform adequately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_45;I'm willing to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_45;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_46;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. To call [From.GetHerHis] performance "bad" would be charitable, to say the least, and it would doubtlessly be a major undertaking to make [From.GetHerHim] perform at even the lowest level you would deem acceptable for a WArrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_46;I do like a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_46;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_47;Despite giving [From.GetBestName] a fair opportunity to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] worthy of being your student, which is well within your rights, [From.GetSheHe] does not agree to the idea, seemingly operating under the impression that all [From.GetSheHe] has to do is ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_47;In that case, I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_48;It seems you have impressed [From.GetBestName] with your skills as [From.GetSheHe] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] is uncertain [From.GetSheHe] could teach you much, suggesting that [better_mentor.GetBestName] might be a better mentor. [From.GetBestName] has offered to ask [better_mentor.GetHerHim] for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_48;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_48;No, I want you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_49;Though you would have expected [From.GetBestName] to accept your offer to try to get [better_mentor.GetBestName] to teach [From.GetHerHim] instead as that likely would be more beneficial [From.GetBestName] surprises you by demanding that you mentor [From.GetHerHim] personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_49;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_49;In that case, I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_50;While your request seems to have taken [From.GetBestName] by surprise it evidently was a good idea to ask as [From.GetSheHe] has agreed to take you on despite [From.GetHerHis] initial reservations. Perhaps you will not learn as much as you might be able to learn with another mentor, but you might prove yourself sooner with a worse mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_50;As I predicted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_51;It seems you displeased [From.GetBestName] by insisting that [From.GetSheHe] should mentor you personally as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to entertain the notion and has rescinded [From.GetHerHis] previous offer to help you get another mentor. You will have to ask someone else in person, it would seem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_51;That was unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_52;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], telling you that [From.GetBestName] approached [FromFrom.GetBestName] in the hopes of being mentored and that [From.GetBestName] was skilled enough that [FromFrom.GetBestName] thinks you would make for a better mentor for [From.GetBestName] as [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s own skills might be insufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_52;I would be happy to teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_52;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_53;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that I have seen fit to accept you as my student, as requested by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. I hope that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_53;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_54;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has accepted me as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student. I thank you for your help in arranging this.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_54;It was my pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_55;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] speaks highly of you I do not think it would be in my interests to mentor you as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has requested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_55;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_56;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nDespite your letter to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] [FromFrom.GetBestName] has refused to mentor me. I ask that you mentor me instead, as I initially requested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_56;I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_56;I won't mentor you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_57;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIf [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you then I am prepared to do so, in accordance with what you initially suggested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_57;Works for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_58;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am surprised that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you, but though it certainly is not ideal for you I am still not prepared to mentor you personally.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_58;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_59;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou have performed quite well, and I would definitely be willing to mentor you so that you may learn what little you have to learn before you have proven yourself.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_59;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_60;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, but I am still willing to mentor you so that you may become truly worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_60;Well, that's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_61;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile your performance was decent enough I must say that I would rather not mentor you. Go find someone else that would be willing to do that.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_61;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_62;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, and I therefore have no interest in mentoring you. I wish you better luck elsewhere.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_62;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_63;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand money in exchange for mentoring me I still think that that is an acceptable bargain.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_63;A deal is a deal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_64;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI think it is quite dishonest of you to demand money in exchange for mentoring me, and I have no interest in any such arrangement. I will look elsewhere for a mentor.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_64;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_65;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand a Favor in exchange for mentoring me I still think that that is an acceptable bargain.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_68B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\n[FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor me as I seek to prove myself a worthy Warrior of the Rising Sun.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_68C;[Root.GetBestName],\n[From.GetBestName] will be mentoring me from now on, and I look forward to proving that I am your superior in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_68;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_68;Let's see what the future holds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_68;You are a fool to oppose me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_69A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am quite happy to hear that we now share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName] and look forward to spending more time together.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_69B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been told that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor you as well. I hope we can be friends, or at least not rivals.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_69C;[Root.GetBestName],\nI hear [From.GetBestName] will be mentoring you from now on, and I look forward to proving that I am your superior in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_69;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_69;Let's see what the future holds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_69;You are a fool to oppose me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_70;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has come to my attention that you do not yet have a mentor, and I humbly offer to mentor you so that you may advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_70;That works for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_70;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_71;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is most definitely welcome, and I see no reason not to accept. I hope that this will be mutually beneficial.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_71;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_72;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is kind, but I think that another mentor would be more beneficial for me, so I must refuse your offer.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_72;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_76;As part of your mentoring duties you are expected to help [From.GetBestName] improve [From.GetHerHis] skills when it comes to a variety of weapons. One of those weapons is the sword, which many would consider the most important weapon in the arsenal of any warrior. Perhaps it is time to give [From.GetBestName] a swordfighting lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_76;"The sword is an elegant weapon...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_76;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_77;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has seen fit to plan a swordfighting lesson for you, stating that it is something that [From.GetSheHe] thinks is a mandatory part of the training that every Warrior of the Rising Sun must undergo and further informing you that the sword is an elegant weapon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_77;"... for a civilized age!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_77;I don't have time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_78;While other, less civilized, cultures might think that the bow is a weapon that is only fit for hunting for for the peasantry, the Warriors of the Rising Sun have other opinions on the matter. It would probably not be amiss to spend some time working on marksmanship as part of your mentoring of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_78;I should give [From.GetHerHim] a few tips!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_78;I have other plans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_79;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has announced that [From.GetSheHe] think it would be wise for the two of you to dedicate some time towards working on your skills with a bow, stating that it is good for every warrior to be a skilled archer even though there are those that are not Warriors of the Rising Sun that would look down on you for using a bow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_79;I think archery is useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_79;This is not for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_80;Though the sword obviously is the weapon that a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should prefer in melee combat there are situations where a spear is more useful, and it would probably be amiss not to give [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to handle that weapon in case [From.GetSheHe] should need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_80;I can give a few tips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_80;Let's not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_81;Though you have been told that the sword is the best weapon for melee combat, your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has also suggested that there are situations where it might be a good idea to use something else, and now [From.GetSheHe] is suggesting that the two of you should spend some time practicing with a spear in case you ever need to use one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_81;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_81;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_82;Though it would not be amiss to spend some time giving [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to fight on horseback, it would probably also be a good idea to spend some time just working on basic horsemanship as there are those that end up neglecting that to their detriment because they focus too much on mounted combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_82;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_82;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_83;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], surprises you one day by announcing that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the two of you should spend the day riding and that the day's activities should not involve weapon practice. Perhaps there is wisdom in that suggestion, as knowing how to handle a horse without a weapon at the ready could be important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_83;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_83;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_84;You have heard it said that less civilized cultures look down on a [Root.GetManWoman] using a bow from horseback on the battlefield instead of fighting with a close range weapon during mounted combat, you know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun do not share that belief. Perhaps it is time to instruct [From.GetBestName] in mounted archery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_84;That will be today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_84;I don't want to do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_85;[From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] intends for your next lesson to be on the matter of mounted archery, stating that it is a perfectly valid approach to combat despite what some foreign barbarians might think. You are of course familiar with using a bow from horseback, but perhaps it would not be amiss to go along with the plan even so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_85;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_85;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_86;The sword is a useful weapon, and is generally what one would expect a warrior to use when fighting a duel on foot or in many other combat circumstances. However, it is also a weapon that can be used on horseback, and it might be a good idea to have a lesson on the subject as part of [From.GetBestName]'s training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_86;It is certainly worthwhile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_86;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_87;[From.GetBestName] has sent you instructions to ready your horse and bring your sword as well, stating that your next lesson should be on the subject of mounted swordsmanship. Even though you know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun think that fighting on foot with your sword is the most honorable approach to combat this lesson might still be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_87;Great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_87;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_88;Using a spear on horseback is a bit different from using one on foot. As part of the mentoring of [From.GetBestName], it might be valuable to spend some time working on the mounted approach, as there are sadly warriors who neglect it in favor of other approaches to combat even when those would be actively detrimental.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_88;Time to saddle up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_88;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_89;One day your mentor, [From.GetBestName], informs you that [From.GetSheHe] intends to give you a lesson in how to use a spear in mounted combat. While you already have some idea of how that works, it would perhaps not be amiss to spend some time working on it even so as [From.GetBestName] perhaps has a few useful tips you have not heard before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_89;Fetch me a horse and a spear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_89;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_90;Though a Warrior of the Rising Sun is expected to keep a sword within reach at nearly all times and usually also will be keeping other weapons on hand there might be circumstances where a warrior is separated from all of their weapons. It woiuld be shameful to be caught in such a situation, but it might still be worth training [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_90;Time to put weapons aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_90;This seems unnecessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_91;To your surprise, [From.GetBestName] tells you to put your weapons aside one day when your lessons are about to begin, stating that it would be a good idea for you to learn how to fight if you end up being separated from your weapons for one reason or another. It would probably be good to know what to do in such a situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_91;This might be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_91;This does not interest me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_92;A Warrior of the Rising Sun is supposed to be honorable at all times, and there are few things as honorable as ensuring that the law is followed at all times. This is probably not unknown to [From.GetBestName], but as [From.GetHerHis] mentor it might be good for you to ensure that [From.GetSheHe] is aware of this being the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_92;This is important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_92;I don't have time for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_93;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss your opinions on the subject of laws and justice. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quite pleased when [From.GetSheHe] hears that the two of you are in agreement on the subject, stating that there are other Warriors of the Rising Sun that have other, incorrect, opinions on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_93;Justice will be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_94;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss your opinions on the subject of laws and justice. You know that all Warriors of the Rising Sun are supposed to be honorable, and that there are those that think that being honorable and following the law is the same thing, but you have not considered the matter in detail before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_94;Justice is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_94;Laws sometimes have to be broken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_95;While the Warriors of the Rising Sun are open to having members that are not [Root.Religion.GetName] and on rare occasions have permitted members that have quite exotic religions, it is clear that most foreign ways are incompatible with being an honorable warrior. It might be wise to instruct [From.GetBestName] about the dangers of foreign ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_95;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_95;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_96;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], seems to be concerned by the fact that foreign barbarians might have religions that are inherently incompatible with being honorable, as [From.GetSheHe] spends a large part of a day talking about the matter and how it is important for all Warriors of the Rising Sun to not be led astray by those following foreign religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_96;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_96;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_97;Your religion has sometimes been something of a sore point when it comes to your interactions with other Warriors of the Rising Sun, as there are those that think that your faith is too foreign to be something that an honorable warrior could follow. As part of mentoring [From.GetBestName] it might be possible to make [From.GetHerHim] more open-minded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_97;This is an opportunity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_97;This would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_98;It is well known that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], follows a religion that is quite unusual for a Warrior of the Rising Sun, and there are those that think that this makes [From.GetHerHim] inherently dishonorable. Your mentor has been telling you that the [From.Religion.GetName] religion is not as dishonorable as people might think.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_98;Well, they seem alright to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_98;Your religion is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_99;Your student, [From.GetBestName], is not a follower of one of the main religions of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and though there are those that think that foreign religions always are dishonorable you have to admit that [From.GetBestName] is honorable. Perhaps there is some merit to not dismissing an entire religion out of hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_99;I should keep an open mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_99;Those ways are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_100;You are surprised to learn that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], is not as prejudiced towards the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as many other Warriors of the Rising Sun have been in the past. [From.GetSheHeCap] has even gone as far as saying that your honor proves that it would be foolish to dismiss an entire religion as being inherently dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_100;I'm glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_101;Both you and your student, [From.GetBestName], follow faiths that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and you are reasonably certain that both of you have faced prejudice as a result. Though your beliefs do not match, perhaps it would be good for both of you to respect each other's faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_101;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_101;Their faith is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_102;Both you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], follow faiths that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and you are reasonably certain that both of you have faced prejudice as a result. Though your beliefs do not match, perhaps it would be good for both of you to respect each other's faith?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_102;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_102;Their faith is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_103;Your student, [From.GetBestName], and you are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, which often is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun hold against you. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice you face will disappear anytime soon, it is certainly good to know that you have a potential ally of the same faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_103;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_104;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], and you are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, which often is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun hold against you. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice you face will disappear anytime soon, it is certainly good to know that you have a potential ally of the same faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_104;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_105;[From.GetBestName] has been your student for a while, and you feel that the two of you have become quite close as a result. Perhaps your relationship should change from simply being a relationship between metor and student and take on a more intimate character? It is not completely unheard of for such things to happen, after all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_105;I will proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_105;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_106;[From.GetBestName] has been mentoring you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a while, and the two of you have become rather close as a result. Even so, you are taken by surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps the two of you should have a more intimate relationship than you currently have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_106;What a lovely idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_106;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_107;[From.GetBestName] was quite flattered by your suggestion, and it did not take the two of you a long time to find a secluded location for lovemaking. Though you certainly still need to spend some time on activities related to training [From.GetBestName] to become a better Warrior of the Rising Sun, that will definitely not be the only thing you do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_107;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_108;You approached [From.GetBestName] with the suggestion of a more intimate relationship, but though the two of you are close [From.GetBestName] courteously but firmly told you that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for a intimate relationship and that [From.GetSheHe] thinks such a relationship with one of [Root.GetHerHis] students would be improper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_108;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_109;You and [From.GetBestName] have been working closely together for a while now, and both of you definitely enjoy each other's company. Though you might not always be working as closely together in the future you are still confident that you have made a friend for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give you an ally should you ever need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_109;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_110;You and [From.GetBestName] have been working closely together for a while now, and both of you definitely enjoy each other's company. Though you might not always be working as closely together in the future you are still confident that you have made a friend for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give you an ally should you ever need one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_110;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_111;Personal combat is something that every Warrior of the Rising Sun should be familiar with, but a true Warrior of the Rising Sun is also a good commander, and you and [From.GetBestName] should probably spend some time working on both strategy and tactics while you are mentoring [From.GetHerHim] instead of neglecting it for other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_111;Let's discuss warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_111;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_112;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has let you know that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is time for the two of you to work on the subjects of strategy and tactics, as while a Warrior of the Rising Sun that cannot fight in personal combat is a poor warrior one that cannot command other warriors on the battlefield is also a poor warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_112;Let's discuss warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_112;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_113;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and though you have seen shirabyoshi performances that have been quite entertaining their outfits, particularly their swords, have often seemed a bit odd to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_113;Women with swords! How silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_113;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_114;One day you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has opinions about the fact that shirabyoshi wear those outfits, as [From.GetSheHe] speaks dismissively of them and the fact that they are wearing swords that [From.GetSheHe] does not think they deserve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_114;They are indeed quite silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_114;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_115;It seems that your student, [From.GetBestName], does not share your opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that you might be wrong about them being wrong to wear their chosen clothing and to carry swords. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks that they might be more skilled at fighting than most believe and worthy of respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_115;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_116;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and they also wear swords at their side, much like you do. Perhaps they are as worthy of them as you are?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_116;Don't underestimate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_116;They aren't warriors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_117;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Your mentor comments on the fact that they wear swords at their side and that there are those that would look down on them, but notes that her existence proves that women can be worthy of carrying swords.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_117;They could indeed be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_117;They are not true warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_118;It seems that your student, [From.GetBestName], does not share your opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that they make a mockery of true warriors everywhere and that respecting them is uncalled for, since even though you are a female warrior that does not mean that women are suited to be warriors in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_118;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_119;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and they also wear swords at their side. Perhaps you should warn your student that she needs to prove herself better than them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_119;Hold them up as a warning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_119;Let's not be hasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_120;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Your mentor comments on their appearance and the fact that the have swords at their side in a disparaging manner, and also suggests that you will need to work hard to prove yourself better than them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_120;Ignore the insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_120;Speak out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_121;It seems that your student, [From.GetBestName], does not share your opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that you should not be so hasty in dismissing either them or her, and also states that women are just as fit at fighting as men are even though they rarely get the opportunity to prove it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_121;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_122;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and they also wear swords at their side, much like you and your student, and it is certainly not something that should be discouraged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_122;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_123;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Your mentor comments on the fact that they are wearing swords at their side, much like the two of you are, and states plainly that women should be permitted to wear and wield them if they wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_123;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_124;You have been a Warrior of the Rising Sun for quite some time, and though the Warriors of the Rising Sun pride themselves on their honor you have always thought that honor is not quite as important as some others might think at certain times. Perhaps it would be useful to share this insight with your student, [From.GetBestName]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_124;Honor has its limits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_124;Let's not bring this up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_125;You have always been told that a Warrior of the Rising Sun should act with honor, and you would have thought that this sentiment was shared by your mentor, [From.GetBestName]. However, to your suprise, [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that there are times that honor should be ignored in favor of a more pragmatic solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_125;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_125;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_126;Your attempt to teach [From.GetBestName] that honor is not always of utmost importance has gone poorly, as [From.GetSheHe] rather firmly has told you that [From.GetSheHe] disagrees with that notion. Though you manage to salvage the situation quickly enough that your student hopefully will not think too much about what you said.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_126;Unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_127;You and your student, [From.GetBestName], have come to dislike one another quite a bit since you first started mentoring [From.GetHerHim]. You cannot dismiss them out of hand, and you are not prepared to declare them worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun just to get rid of them, but you could suggest a practice duel to first blood and try to harm them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_127;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_127;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_128;You and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], do not exactly see eye-to-eye, and you suspect that both of you would like nothing more than to be rid of one another. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now suggested a practice duel to first blood, and though it would be unwise to try to kill [From.GetHerHim] you could try to harm [From.GetHerHim] quite a bit, if you accept the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_128;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_128;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_129;It seems your student, [From.GetBestName], has no interest in your proposed practice duel. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] saw through your plan to push things as far as you could without actively killing [From.GetHerHim] and elected not to take the risk, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is just a coward that does not deserve as good a teacher as you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_129;I think it is cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_130;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way you had intended for it to go. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of your student killing you, as [From.GetSheHe] easily avoids your sword and quickly inflicts a major wound on you. It seems like it was a bad idea to issue the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_130;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_131;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as you had planned. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound you that you easily avoid, and you quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] ability to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself] clearly is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_131;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_132;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way you had intended for it to go. Though you manage to hold [From.GetHerHim] off for a while and come close to wounding [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] eventually gains the upper hand and manages to wound you.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_132;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_133;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided, you manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_133;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_137;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_138;While [From.GetBestName] is a promising student [From.GetSheHe] still has quite far to go before [From.GetSheHe] is ready, as far as you can tell. However, from the way [From.GetSheHe] is acting as of late it seems as if [From.GetSheHe] thinks otherwise, and correcting those assumptions might perhaps drive a wedge between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_138;I could let them pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_138;They're not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_139;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you for what you expect to be routine training session even though you have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach you anything more at this point. However, to your great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that your training is at an end as you have proven yourself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_139;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_140;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you one day and tells you that even though you might have started wondering whether you already are at the point where you have proven yourself worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun your training is not yet complete, and [From.GetSheHe] implies that you will not be ready for quite some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_140;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_140;I AM READY!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_141;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that you are intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim]. Though this certainly is not the case, your attempt to convince them otherwise only ends up making things worse, and it soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views you as an enemy of [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_141;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_142;[From.GetBestName] is a most promising student, and as far as you can tell [From.GetSheHe] is skilled enough that nobody would fault you for declaring [From.GetHerHis] training over. You could of course also choose to delay things in case you do not wish for [From.GetBestName] to advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_142;That would be dishonest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_142;I will hold them back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_143;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you for what you expect to be routine training session even though you have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach you anything more at this point.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_145;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that you are intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim]. This is of course the case, and your attempt to convince them otherwise only ends up making things worse, and it soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views you as an enemy of [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_145;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_146;Your student, [From.GetBestName], apparently thinks that [From.GetSheHe] is being held back even though you are not holding [From.GetHerHim] back, as [From.GetSheHe] has told you as much to your face. Clearly, you will need to tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth, and you will need to do so in a convincing fashion to avoid turning [From.GetHerHim] into an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_146;I can explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_147;For a while now, you have been suspecting that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding you back and that you perhaps were at the point where you had proven that you are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. However, when you confronted [From.GetBestName] about it, [From.GetSheHe] quickly managed to convince you otherwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_147;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_148;For a while now, you have been suspecting that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding you back and that you perhaps were at the point where you had proven that you are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. When you confronted [From.GetBestName] about it [From.GetHerHis] response was highly suspicious, which you feel confirms your suspicion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_148;You LIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_149;Your attempt to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] is in need of further training did not go as intended, as [From.GetSheHe] took what you said as confirmation that you were holding [From.GetHerHim] back even though you are not. As a consequence of this, [From.GetBestName] now seems to view you as an enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_149;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_150;[From.GetBestName]'s training has now reached the point where it would be pointless for both of you to continue it any further, as [From.GetSheHe] definitely is worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun. It it time to inform [From.GetHerHim] of the good news, and perhaps also time to look for another student if there is anyone in need of a mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_150;I can teach you no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_151;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you for what you expect to be routine training session even though you have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] cannot teach you anything more at this point. However, to your great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that your training is at an end as you have proven yourself a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_151;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_152;You and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFrom.GetBestName], and you have sometimes shared lessons as a result of your shared mentor. As a result you have gotten to know each other quite well, and you feel certain that you would be able to count on [From.GetBestName] as a friend and ally if you ever need [From.GetHerHis] assistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_152;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_153;You and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and you have sometimes shared lessons as a result of your shared mentor.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_153;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_154;You have spent quite some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of you share a mentor and both of you seek to prove yourself worthy of being Warriors of the Rising Sun. As you enjoy each other's company, perhaps it would be possible for the two of you to get involved in a more intimate relationship if that is something that you desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_154;I should proposition them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_154;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_155;You have spent quite some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of you share a mentor and both of you seek to prove yourself worthy of being Warriors of the Rising Sun, and you have found [From.GetHerHis] company quite enjoyable. One day, [From.GetBestName] suggests that perhaps the two of you should retire somewhere private..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_155;Sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_155;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_156;[From.GetBestName] is receptive to your suggestion, and it does not take the two of you long to find somewhere private to engage in lovemaking. Though you probably should be discreet about your relationship to ensure that your mentor does not find out about it, knowing that you have a lover around will likely make things rather more enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_156;I knew this would end well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_157;Though [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous when replying to your suggestion the reply is still negative. While it hopefully will not result in things between the two of you becoming strained, you are still somewhat disappointed to hear that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in a relationship with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_157;Well, that went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_158;You share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of you having several lessons together. Though you initially had hoped that you and your fellow student would get along, it is rather clear to you that that is not to be since [From.GetBestName] is highly competitive and sees you as a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_158;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_159;You share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of you having several lessons together.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_159;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_160;As you and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove your worth to [FromFrom.GetBestName] you have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between your official lessons since that might help you advance more quickly. Of late, your sessions have been more frequent, and as far as you can tell they are starting to yield some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_160;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_161;As you and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove your worth to [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] you have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between your official lessons since that might help you advance more quickly.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_161;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_162;You have spent some time around [From.GetBestName] as the two of you share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and in your opinion [From.GetSheHe] has always been acting a bit dishonestly. Today you found irrefutable proof that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying, which probably is information that [FromFrom.GetBestName] would be quite interested in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_162;Let's confront them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_162;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_163;It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to discover proof that you have not been completely honest in your dealings with your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] has confronted you with this information. It is possible that a bribe might be able to buy [From.GetBestName]'s silence, though that would be dishonorable as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_163;How about some money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_163;How about a Favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_163;I'm calling in my Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RISINGSUN_163;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_164;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing your silence when you confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, as [From.GetBestName] immediately offered to pay you quite a bit of money to make you forget about the matter. It would be dishonorable to accept a bribe, of course, but surely nobody would ever know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_164;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_164;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_165;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing your silence when you confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, as [From.GetBestName] immediately offered to grant you a Favor to make you forget about the matter.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_165;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_165;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_166;You would have thought that the offer of a bribe would have convinced [From.GetBestName] to drop the matter of your little lies to your mentor, but evidently [From.GetSheHe] is a bit too honorable for that to be the case, as [From.GetSheHe] laughed at your offer before leaving to speak with your mentor about what [From.GetSheHe] had discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_166;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_167;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to you. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated, you know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_167;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_168;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing your silence when you confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, as [From.GetBestName] immediately called in the Favor that you owed [From.GetHerHim]. As it would not do to fail to honor the Favor, you have no choice but to remain silent about what you have discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_168;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_169;You initially thought that [From.GetBestName] would offer you some kind of bribe in exchange for your silence on the matter of [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, but apparently there are some limits to what [From.GetSheHe] is willing to do even though [From.GetSheHe] is dishonorable as [From.GetSheHe] laughed in your face and told you to do your worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_169;As you wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_170;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to you. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated, you know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_170;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_171;You and [From.GetBestName] have a shared mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName] and have been given all manner of lessons together. Now both of you have been tasked with reading up on matters of warfare in the Art of War and similar books, and you would definitely learn faster by working together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_171;Let's study together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_173;You and [From.GetBestName] dislike one another quite a bit even though you share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Though you would have hoped that your mentor would have dismissed [From.GetHerHim] out of hand, this has not happened, but perhaps that would change if you fought a duel against [From.GetBestName] and injured [From.GetHerHim] severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_173;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_173;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Now it seems that the two of them have fought a duel against one another, and that one of your students has walked away from it in rather bad shape.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_184;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_185;You and [From.GetBestName] share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and though she seems to be respected by your mentor you are not quite sure she deserves that respect as you have heard many Warriors of the Rising Sun say that women do not belong on the battlefield or in a duel. Perhaps they are right?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_185;You will be a failure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_185;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_186;You have faced a good amount of prejudice among the Warriors of the Rising Sun as quite a few of them seem to be of the opinion that you are going to be a disappointment to everyone just because you are a woman.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_186;Ignore the insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_186;I will be your better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_187;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not like being called out on being a poor warrior by virtue of being a woman, as she angrily told you that she will not only prove herself worthy of being one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but also will prove to everyone that she will be your better, and that you one day will rue the day you made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_187;An empty threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_188;You and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as they do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be.

You have had a good number of interactions with the two of them recently, and you have discovered that you and [From.GetBestName] have quite a few things in common, and you would go as far as to name [From.GetHerHim] your friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_190;This will surely be beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_191;[From.GetBestName], a friend of your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and you have spent some time together recently due to your shared obligations as Warriors of the Rising Sun, and you have gotten to know [From.GetHerHim] quite well as a result and definitely enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company, which seems to be a mutual sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_191;I made a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_192;You have spent some time in the companty of {FromFrom.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] recently, and it seems as if the two of them are getting along quite well. As [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a close friend of yours, this is likely going to be beneficial for your student in the future, and perhaps also for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_192;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_193;Though there are members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that are quite worthy of the honor of being part of the society there are also members who are unworthy of that honor, such as your rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is currently educating a new student, [From.GetBestName], who clearly is yet another unworthy member.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_193;They are now my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_194;Your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], has made no secret of the fact that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] and [From.GetBestName] dislike one another, and while you have been trying to keep an open mind you have realized that [From.GetBestName] clearly does not respect you. It is rather clear that your mentor's rivalry is justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_194;They are now my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_195;You have spoken at length about the dishonorable cretin that is [FromFrom.GetBestName] to your student, [From.GetBestName], and at times it has seemed as if your words have fallen on deaf ears. However, as of today you have learned that your student shares your sentiment about [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dishonorable character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_195;Good! Good! Destroy them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_196;Your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName] in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and from what you have heard [From.GetSheHe] is a quite promising student. Though there are those that would consider it dishonorable to try to steal away someone else's student, perhaps it is justifiable at a time like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_196;Attempt to recruit them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_196;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_198;One day when you are on the way to meet with your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], you are approached by [From.GetBestName], who you know is your mentor's rival. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that your potential is being squandered by your current mentor and offers to take over the mentoring. Even if it is a dishonorable offer, perhaps it is worth accepting?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_198;I pledge myself to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_198;I will never be your student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_199;You make your offer to [From.GetBestName] and are quite pleased to discover that [From.GetSheHe] is open to the suggestion that you should take over as [From.GetHerHis] mentor. It brings you even more satisfaction to be present when your new student informs [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] about what happened, as your rival clearly feels humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_199;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_200;Your student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to your lesson, and to your surprise your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], arrives along with your student. You quickly discover that your rival has convinced your student that [From.GetSheHe] would be better off being mentored by [FromFrom.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_200;Curse you both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_201;You expected [From.GetBestName] to at least give the suggestion that you should become [From.GetHerHis] mentor instead of [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] some consideration before making up [From.GetHerHis] mind, but [From.GetSheHe] informed you that [From.GetSheHe] was not going to abandon [From.GetHerHis] current mentor in no uncertain terms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_201;Well, that didn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_202;Your student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to your lesson. Inquiring as to the reason for the delay, you learn that [FromFrom.GetBestName], your hated rival, apparently demanded to speak to your student as [From.GetSheHe] was on [From.GetHerHis] way to you and attempted to recruit your student, an offer that was refused.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_202;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_203;Among the many Novices seeking to prove themselves worthy of progressing further in the Warriors of the Rising Sun is [From.GetBestName], who clearly shows promise. One day the two of you come across one another by pure chance, and you see an opportunity to give [From.GetBestName] some quick advice to help [From.GetHerHim]..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_203;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_204;You have occasionally come across other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun than your mentor during your training, and though some of them have seen fit to essentially ignore you others have been rather helpful. One of the more helpful people you have met is [From.GetBestName], who recently gave you some good advice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_204;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_205;You have met a good number of Warriors of the Rising Sun over the years, and many of them have been quite dismissive towards you because you are a woman. Doubtlessly, this is something that [From.GetBestName] also will encounter over the years to come, and she would probably have an easier time if she got some help from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_205;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_206;[From.GetBestName] approaches you one day to express her appreciation of the fact that you have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers you a few quick tips as to how you could deal with the situation and how you could prove yourself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_206;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_207;[FromFrom.GetBestName] and you have both faced prejudice because you are women and many Warriors of the Rising Sun find it hard to accept that you are skilled warriors. Doubtlessly, this is something that [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s student, [From.GetBestName], will have to deal with as well, and she woud probably have an easier time if she got a few tips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_207;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_208;[From.GetBestName] approaches you one day to express her appreciation of the fact that you have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers you a few quick tips as to how you could deal with the situation and how you could prove yourself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_208;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_209;Your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] has taken a disliking to you, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove that you are unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_209;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_210;Your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] has taken a disliking to you, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove that you are unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_210;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_211;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals you and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well during your interactions. Though you suspect that your respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of you are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_211;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_212;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals you and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well during your interactions. Though you suspect that your respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of you are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_212;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_213;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals you and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well during your interactions. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to thoroughly enjoy your company, and you enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company as well, and perhaps the two of you could take things in a more intimate direction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_213;I will proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_213;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_214;One day you are approached by [From.GetBestName], the student of a rival of your mentor's. The two of you have always gotten along rather well despite your mentors not getting along, and [From.GetSheHe] now suggests that the two of you perhaps should take your current relationship in a more intimate direction despite your mentors' animosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_214;That sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_214;You and me? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_215;[From.GetBestName] is quite receptive to your suggestion that the two of you should begin a more intimate relationship, and the two of you quickly find a location where you can have some privacy. Though your mentors doubtlessly would be quite displeased to discover that the two of you now are lovers, hopefully you will be able to avoid discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_215;This turned out well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_216;When approached on the matter [From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in a more intimate relationship with you. Perhaps it is because your mentors would find it highly disagreeable if they ever found out, or perhaps [From.GetBestName] simply is not interested in getting a lover. You probably should not take it personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_216;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_217;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for you and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there is something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for you to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve your respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_217;You're going down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_218;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for you and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there is something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for you to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve your respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_218;You're going down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_219;It is no secret that your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of you have also been getting along quite well when you have been spending time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_219;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_220;It is no secret that your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of you have also been getting along quite well when you have been spending time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_220;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_221;Since your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of you have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and you feel that the two of you are getting along quite well. Maybe the two of you should consider taking your relationship in a more intimate direction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_221;It is worth a shot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_221;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_222;Since your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of you have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and the two of you have been getting along quite well, which doubtlessly pleases your mentors. One day [From.GetBestName] suggests a more intimate relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_222;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_222;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_223;[From.GetBestName] is appreciative of your suggestion, and the two of you soon manage to find someplace private to take your relationship to the next level. Though you perhaps should keep your relationship a secret in case others disapprove of it, it will very likely make future meetings between the two of you even more pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_223;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_224;Thouhg [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous in the way [From.GetSheHe] goes about the matter [From.GetSheHe] still firmly turns down your suggestion that the two of you should consider a more intimate relationship. Perhaps it is for the best, seeing as there might be those that would disapprove of such a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_224;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_225;You have spoken with other Novices in the Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time during your training to see what they were being taught, occasionally getting small tips from them as to how you could improve more quickly. You have also been able to give advice at times, such as when you came across [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_225;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_226;It is not uncommon for you to speak with other Novices seeking to prove themselves true Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time to exchange small bits of advice that might be helpful. Recently, you got a bit of advice from [From.GetBestName] that you think will be quite helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_226;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_227;There has always been a small number of women among the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and some of them have been anything but worthy of that honor. Of late, you have considered [From.GetBestName]'s suitability, wondering if she is someone that deserves to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun. If not, you should probably let her know that she is unworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_227;She is unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_227;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_228;It seems that [From.GetBestName] is one of the members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that is unwilling to accept the fact that a woman could pick up a weapon and wield it just as well as a man as he has told you as much to your face. It is a grave insult, but perhaps he did not mean it the way he said it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_228;Ignore the insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_228;I am more worthy than he is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_229;[From.GetBestName] did not take you informing her that she might be unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun well, which perhaps was not all that suprising, and she angrily proclaimed that she was far more worthy of that honor than you ever would be and that you one day would rue the day that you made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_229;She's clearly in denial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_230;Even though you have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time you have encountered quite a few men who have told you that they do not think you should be a warrior. Doubtlessly [From.GetBestName] has experienced similar prejudice, and doubtlessly it would be easier for both of you to face it together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_230;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_231;Even though you have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time you have encountered quite a few men who have told you that they do not think you should be a warrior.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_232;You send out the call for a worthy commander, and [invited_lodge_soldier.GetBestName] answers it swiftly. Hopefully, [invited_lodge_soldier.GetSheHe] will serve you and the Warriors of the Rising Sun with honor, so that you in turn may be honored for having [invited_lodge_soldier.GetHerHim] at your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_233;As the war comes to an end the band of Ronin that you hired informs you that they will be departing to look for other opportunities now that you no longer have any need for them. Though it perhaps would have been useful to have them around in case you needed them again, perhaps their departure is for the best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_233;They are welcome to leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_234;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], informing you that [FromFrom.GetSheHe], and thus all Warriors of the Rising Sun, now regard you as dishonorable. It should be evident to everyone that this is not the case, but sadly [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s words tend to carry quite a bit of weight among the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_238;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_235;With the death of [From.GetBestName] the invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has been indefinitely postponed. Perhaps the preparations for another invasion will begin before long, or perhaps it is not something that will be attempted again, if the new leader of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has other ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_235;That's good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_240;The promised invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has come.\n\nAt the command of [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetFirstName], the forces of the Warriors of the Rising Sun depart to attack the [rising_sun_subjugation_defender.GetBestName] in order to secure the [rising_sun_subjugation_target.GetFullName].\n\nIf the Warriors of the Rising Sun are victorious, the member that contributed most to the war will be awarded with the kingdom.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_241;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_247;One day when you and [From.GetBestName], a fellow Warrior of the Rising Sun, are staying at the same inn [From.GetSheHe] sees fit to challenge you to a sake drinking contest. Though hardly as honorable as a contest involving martial prowess, it would still be a bit odd to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_247;I don't think this is a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_247;A drinking contest? Count me in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_249;You would have expected [From.GetBestName] to accept your suggestion of a sake drinking contest, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] would rather not engage in such things. Given that it is not a contest in martial prowess, it is perhaps understandable to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_249;I suppose we'll just keep talking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_250;[From.GetBestName] considers your suggestion for a moment and then declares that [From.GetSheHe] accepts your challenge. [From.GetSheHeCap] motions the innkeeper over to where you are seated and tells the woman to bring the two of you several cups of sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_252;You know, this was a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_253;Your opponent takes [From.GetHerHis] first drink easily enough and indicates with a gesture that you should get started as way. As there is a cup of sake at the ready in front of you, there is no real reason to delay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_294;I suppose that means I won...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_295;You take another drink and immediately realize that it was a mistake. Rising unsteadily from the table as you struggle to keep the drinks you have had down you stumble towards the door as quickly as you can, hoping to get outside before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_295;Out of the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_296;Your opponent takes another drink and then rises unsteadily to [From.GetHerHis] feet, looking quite ill.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_296;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_300;One day you are approached by [From.GetBestName], a fellow Warrior of the Rising Sun, who suggests that the two of you should engage in a friendly poetry contest. It is quite respectable for a warrior to compose poetry, and a poetry competition is certainly not something that is unheard of, even if it might not help on the battlefield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_300;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_300;A poetry contesy? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_301;You approach [From.GetBestName] to propose a poetry contest, but though you would have expected [From.GetHerHim] to be interested in such a thing it seems you were mistaken. Perhaps you should try again at a later time, or perhaps you should find someone else to challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_301;I'll think of something else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_302;With [From.GetBestName] having agreed to a poetry contest with you it is time for you to decide what you want to write about, as you need a plan before you can get started.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_309;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_309;I did poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_310;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_310;This is awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_311;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It describes you and your accomplishments in quite flattering terms, and it is clear that [From.GetBestName] has put a lot of effort into trying to get on your good side with the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_311;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_312;[From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] found your poem quite impressive and that the words you used to describe [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments certainly were well chosen. It seems you have made a new friend, and a friend among the Warriors of the Rising sun is certainly going to be an advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_312;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_313;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It describes your and your accomplishments in quite unflattering terms, and even though it fills you with anger you reluctantly have to admit that it is not a poor poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_313;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_314;You study [From.GetBestName]'s expression carefully as [From.GetSheHe] reads your poem and can tell that you have done a good job due to [From.GetHerHim] being unable to conceal [From.GetHerHis] anger. Given that [From.GetSheHe] does not say that the quality was poor, you have to assume that you did a good job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_314;Looks like I struck a nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_315;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. The poem makes several insinuations about you and the truth about your acoomplishments, and though you would like nothing better than to claim that it is poorly written you are forced to admit that it is actually a good poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_315;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_316;You can see anger quite clearly on [From.GetBestName]'s face as [From.GetSheHe] takes in what you have written. You initially think that [From.GetSheHe] will claim that it is poorly written in an attempt to save face, but when no such claim is made you become confident that [From.GetBestName] has to admit that it was good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_316;Looks like I struck a nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_317;You can see [From.GetBestName] studying your face carefully as you read [From.GetHerHis] poem. It is quite well-written, and you say as much when you are finished, which seems to please [From.GetHerHim] greatly. However, for some reason, [From.GetHerHis] smile strikes you as a bit odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_317;I must be missing something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_318;You look at [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] reads your poem to see if [From.GetSheHe] spots the veiled insults in the poem, but given that [From.GetSheHe] does not look the least bit upset and actually compliments you on your poem it appears that [From.GetSheHe] has failed to notice what you actually wrote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_318;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_319;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It describes you in quite flattering terms, and you think you detect a hint that [From.GetBestName] might have an interest to get to know you more intimately, even if there is nothing overt in the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_319;I should proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_319;I'm not interested in them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_320;It seems your flirtatious poem was quite good in [From.GetBestName]'s opinion, as [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps the two of you should retire somewhere more privately for a while. Of course, just because you flirted with [From.GetHerHim] it certainly does not have to mean that you want things to go any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_320;Let's find somewhere private!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_320;I don't want to go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_321;Despite attempting to flirt with [From.GetBestName] using your poem it does not appear as if [From.GetSheHe] noticed that that was what you were doing as [From.GetSheHe] does not comment on it as [From.GetSheHe] finishes reading. You were a bit circumspect, but you thought it still was clear enough for [From.GetBestName] to catch on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_321;Perhaps I was too vague...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_322;[From.GetBestName] is receptive to your suggestion, and though you and [From.GetBestName] do not find someplace private quite as quickly as you would have preferred, but after a while you do manage to find someplace where you can become more intimately acquainted with one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_322;That was wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_324;[From.GetBestName] turns down the suggestion that the two of you should retire somewhere more private to get to know each other more intimately. It is possible that what you thought you read was not what [From.GetSheHe] actually meant, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] had no interest in anything beyond a little flirting in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_324;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_325;The poem that your lover, [From.GetBestName], wrote for you was a love poem, and it was quite flattering. The two of you decide to slip away to somewhere more private for a while before resuming the contest, and neither of you see the need to rush things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_325;That was wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_326;Your lover, [From.GetBestName], is quite receptive of the poem you wrote for [From.GetHerHim], and the two of you quickly decide to slip away to somewhere more private for a while. Neither of you is in a great rush to get back to the poetry contest, so it takes you quite some time before you are ready to return to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_326;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_327;[From.GetBestName] has chosen to write a poem about how to wage war. While perhaps an unusual subject for a poem, the poem you have been given to read is quite good and also manages to give you some ideas you might wish to put to the test on the battlefield in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_327;That was well written!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_328;Your poem about warfare was well received by [From.GetBestName], who tells you that it both has merit as a poem and perhaps could be useful to teach other Warriors of the Rising Sun some things about how they should approach battlefield command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_328;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_329;[From.GetBestName] has written a poem about nature. It is a quite common subject, and you have come across many poems written by poets that do not look further than the obvious cherry blossoms when writing on that subject, but [From.GetBestName] has actually done a good job and paints a very vivid picture with [From.GetHerHis] words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_329;That was beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_330;You were a bit afraid that your poem about nature would be poorly received because you had elected to not go for a common approach to the subject, but [From.GetBestName] praises your work once [From.GetSheHe] is done reading, telling you that it was a very refreshing take on the subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_330;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_331;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is on the subject of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, which is not your faith and normally not a faith you would have much interest in, but [From.GetBestName]'s words are quite beautiful and you get the feeling that perhaps [From.GetHerHis] religion is not as strange as you previously had thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_331;I understand them more now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_332;You considered it a bit daring to write a poem about the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as [From.GetBestName] follows the [From.Religion.GetName] faith instead, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] was appreciative of it as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that it has made [From.GetHerHim] interested in learning more in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_332;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_333;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is on the subject of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, which is a proper subject for a poet to choose, and [From.GetSheHe] has written a theologically valid work in your opinion. The poem is also quite excellent when it comes to the word choice, so it has other merits as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_333;That was well written!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_334;As both you and [From.GetBestName] share the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith it was perhaps very safe to write about it, though if you had done a poor job it might have come across as an affront even so. You had nothing to worry about, however, as [From.GetBestName] tells you that the poem is quite good and theologically sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_334;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_335;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is on the subject of personal combat, specifically with a sword, and personal combat is of course highly regarded by the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Though poems often are quite abstract you feel that the poem you have in your hands is rather informative, and you feel that you perhaps have gained some new insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_335;A fine poem indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_336;[From.GetBestName] compliments you on your poem about personal combat, telling you that it is rare for such a poem to be as informative as yours. Given that there are no complaints about the writing itself you are confident that [From.GetBestName] also considers it a good poem based on other merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_336;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_337;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. Reading it, you notice that it appears to be an attempt to paint you in flattering terms, but [From.GetBestName]'s approach to it leaves something to be desired, and some parts of the poem almost reads as insults instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_337;That wasn't nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_338;You had expected [From.GetBestName] to appreciate your attempt at flattery, but [From.GetSheHe] looks quite displeased when [From.GetSheHe] is done reading and tells you that your poem is borderline insulting in some places but that [From.GetSheHe] will give you the benefit of the doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_338;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_339;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It quickly becomes clear that the poem is supposed to insult you, but the poor quality of the writing and the poor choice of insults almost makes you laugh instead of making you angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_339;This poem is the true insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_340;You had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would get insulted by your poem as you wrote it to achieve that, but instead of getting visibly angry [From.GetSheHe] smiles and tells you that making [From.GetHerHim] read such a shoddy work is rather insulting since [From.GetSheHe] had expected you to at least make an effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_340;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_341;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. The poem is a poorly written attempt to slander you, and it is quite clear that [From.GetBestName] both is an unskilled poet and is unable to come up with something truly slanderous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_341;I have been called worse by better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_342;Your attempt to slander [From.GetBestName] with your poem did not go well, as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that a child would have been more imaginative and also would have been a better poet. [From.GetSheHeCap] also muses that it is questionable whether the rest of the Warriors of the Rising Sun will take more offense at the slander or the poor quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_342;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_343;You can see [From.GetBestName] studying your face carefully as you read [From.GetHerHis] poem, and it quickly becomes clear why. Though it appears as if [From.GetBestName] has attempted to be stealthy, [From.GetHerHis] poem rather clearly contains several poorly vailed insults, and it is also poorly written in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_343;This was poorly done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_344;You look at [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] reads your poem to see if [From.GetSheHe] spots the veiled insults in the poem, and there is no doubt that [From.GetSheHe] has as [From.GetSheHe] tells you as much and also tells you that your poem is poorly written even when you ignore your dishonorable conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_344;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_345;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. Judging by the way [From.GetBestName] describes you in the poem and several rather coarse suggestions it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to flirt with you using [From.GetHerHis] poem, but if so the result is almost insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_345;That wasn't very nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_346;[From.GetBestName] finishes reading your poem and quickly tells you that [From.GetSheHe] does not appreciate the terms you used to describe [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] will not take it as an insult, but it is quite evident that your attempt to flirt has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_346;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_347;[From.GetBestName] has written a poem about warfare, and though the abstract nature of many poems means it would be fair to not expect too much from the poem you get the distinct feeling that [From.GetBestName] does not understand warfare even half as well as [From.GetSheHe] would be expected to as a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_347;This is all wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_348;[From.GetBestName] swiftly reads your poem about warfare after you hand it to [From.GetHerHim] and immediately tells you that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that you perhaps should have chosen another subject to write about given that the battle you describe sounds very confusing. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] even wonders if your knowledge about the matter is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_348;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_349;You are not surprised to discover that [From.GetBestName]'s poem is about nature, as it is a very common subject for poets to write about, but you are a bit surprised that [From.GetBestName] has elected to not look very far for inspiration and instead has gone for a rather too common choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_349;Cherry blossoms are overdone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_350;[From.GetBestName] finishes reading your poem and lets out a sigh, telling you that [From.GetSheHe] had hoped that your poem would be a bit more imaginative than just another nature poem about cherry blossoms in the wind. [From.GetSheHeCap] also indicates that the poem might be a bit lacking in other respects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_350;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_351;[From.GetBestName] has written a poem about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, and you do not like what you are reading. If [From.GetSheHe] wanted to exalt [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] and the righteousness of those that follow the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, [From.GetBestName] should have put in more effort than [From.GetSheHe] actually did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_351;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_352;Your poem about the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is poorly received by [From.GetBestName], who tells you that it certainly is not painting [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful in a good light and also tells you that you would have had to put in far more of an effort to write a good poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_352;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_353;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is about personal combat, and even when you mentally concede that a poem perhaps is not all that good at teaching someone anything about swordfighting you cannot quite shake the feeling that [From.GetBestName] also lacks an understanding of the subject matter that goes beyond how to write a good poem about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_353;That's not right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_354;[From.GetBestName] informs you that your poem sadly is not all that good and indicates that many Warriors of the Rising Sun might get a bit confused about just what you meant by the way you described the swordfighting in the poem. Perhaps [From.GetBestName] even wonders if your knowledge about the matter is lacking..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_354;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_356;After reading each other's poem and also showing them to a few other parties that you both agreed would be unbiased it has become clear that your poem was the better poem. With that, the contest is concluded, and it is time for you and your opponent to get back to other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_356;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_356;I could easily have lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_357;After reading each other's poem and also showing them to a few other parties that you both agreed would be unbiased it has become clear that your poem was the worse one. With that, the contest is concluded, and it is time for you and your opponent to get back to other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_357;I almost won that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_357;It wasn't even close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_359;Your education is, sadly, a bit lacking, and though you have yet to excel as a Warrior of the Rising Sun you have picked up a few useful things related to warfare over the years. Perhaps it would be better to dedicate yourself to that area instead, as it definitely is something that might make people respect you more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_359;I should focus on war instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_359;I don't think that would be better...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_360;As part of the Warriors of the Rising Sun it is only natural that you practice with various weapons on a frequent basis, and in addition to making you better at wielding those weapons your training has made you a bit stronger in general, which doubtlessly will be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_360;I am stronger than yesterday!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_361;You have been working to improve your skills as a warrior and your skills as a commander quite a bit since you joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and though it sometimes can be a bit tedious you are seeing some promising results. You are also starting to see more value in hard work in general than you previusly did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_361;I will work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_362;While less civilized cultures teach their warriors that the correct approach to warfare and personal combat the Warriors of the Rising Sun disagree about that, and you have been working hard to get better at approaching those matters in a slower, more measured way, which is starting to yield results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_362;A warrior's greatest weapon is patience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_363;The Warriors of the Rising Sun are many, and no matter how skilled any one of them might be you have seen more than a few of them lose duels because they were too proud of their own abilities to consider the fact that their opponents might be skilled as well, and you do not wish to make the same mistake in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_363;I should not think too highly of myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_364;Though there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun that are of the belief that it is of interest for every warrior to be humble enough to consider that they might have more to learn you are quite confident in your abilities and do not really see why you should make a secret of the fact that you are a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_364;I am worthy of praise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_365;While there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun that seem perfectly content with what they have at the moment you are not one of them. As a skilled warrior you are obvously in a position to get more, and aside from making sure that you are acting in an honorable fashion there is little reason not to try to get more than you already have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_365;I deserve all I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_366;There are many kinds of warriors, and there are many skills that might be of use for a warrior, but there is little doubt that courage is one of the most important ones. As a Warrior of the Rising Sun, you have been keeping this in mind a lot recently, and you have managed to overcome some of your previous fears as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_366;Fear is for the enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_367;While there are those that say that wars are full of deception and that would suggest that a Warrior of the Rising Sun should be prepared to use even the most dishonorable and dishonest tactics to win, you are convinced that those people are wrong. Honor is important, and deceit is dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_367;Honesty is honorable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_368;A Warrior of the Rising Sun is supposed to be honorable, and there is honor in following the law no matter what benefits there might be to not doing so at times. You have been thinking about this quite a bit recently and have also been studying various applicable laws to ensure that you are not disobeying any of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_368;Being just is honorable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_369;While most Warriors of the Rising Sun are honorable and thus try to avoid deceit, the same can not be said for most people, and of late you have become more and more worried that the people around you that are not Warriors of the Rising Sun might be trying to take advantage of you because they think that you trust that everyone is honorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_369;I must be on my guard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_370;It is well known that the Warriors of the Rising Sun value honor and honesty, and you consider it equally well known that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonest and dishonorable. As [member_to_discredit_rival_to.GetBestName] does not appear to share your opinion about the latter at this time, perhaps you could change that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_370;I will give it a try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_370;This is not worth my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_371;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. You have long known that the two of them do not like one another, but you had not heard the full story before, and it is fairly obvious to you that [From.GetBestName] deserves your friendship and [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] deserves nothing short of your enmity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_371;How could I have missed this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_372;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. Despite the fact that it is your rival that has been acting in a dishonorable manner when interacting with you it seems that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] still has managed to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] should oppose you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_372;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_373;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and after you finish [From.GetSheHe] is convinced that you are in the right. Though you needed to embellish a few things and perhaps did not mention some minor details concerning your actions, it was probably the right decision to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_373;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_374;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Based on what you are told it is very possible that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and should be regarded as a threat, but as [From.GetBestName] very likely is biased you are not entirely certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_374;Maybe I should keep my guard up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_375;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. Though it seems that [From.GetBestName] has some reservations [From.GetSheHe] still seems to be at least somewhat convinced that your dishonorable rival is correct about you being dishonorable, even though this obviously is false.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_375;Could have been better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_376;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and though [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] is not fully convinced that things are as bad as you say that they are you feel that you still have managed to make [From.GetHerHim] at least somewhat suspicious of your rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_376;Could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_377;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has quite a few things to say about [From.GetHerHis] rival, and what [From.GetSheHe] says would certainly be cause for concern if [From.GetSheHe] is speaking truly, but you are unsure whether that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_377;I'm not sure what to think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_378;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. You would have expected your arguments to have been convincing, but when you are finished [From.GetBestName] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] is no more convinced than when you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_378;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_379;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Though [From.GetBestName] can point to many things that [From.GetSheHe] thinks proves that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and someone that should be your enemy you feel that what you are being told is somewhat distorted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_379;I think this isn't true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_380;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. It seems that [From.GetSheHe] was unconvinced, however, and that [From.GetSheHe] now suspects the truth about your rival being the dishonorable party and that you are in the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_380;That is good to know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_381;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when you are finished [From.GetSheHe] says that there are parts of what you have said that make no sense. As you had to be a bit creative about how you framed some things, that is perhaps to be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_381;Well, that's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_382;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. As far as you can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is blowing things massively out of proportion and [From.GetHerHis] own actions seem rather dishonest when you consider them. Evidently, things are not as [From.GetSheHe] says they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_382;It is the other way around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_383;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. Luckily for you, your rival failed to make [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lies convincing, and [From.GetBestName] now considers you a friend and your rival someone that should be [From.GetHerHis] enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_383;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_384;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when you are done [From.GetSheHe] tells you that what you have said has convinced [From.GetHerHim] that you are the dishonorable party and that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is in the right. It seems you have gained a new enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_384;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_385;It is not uncommon for small numbers of Warriors of the Rising Sun to get together to discuss military matters with one another, and today you attended such a meeting. Based on waht happened there, it was time well spent, and you look forward to the next such meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_385;I learned some new things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_385;My input was appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_387;Today you took part in a discussion about the advancement of military knowledge with other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Though it of course is important to preserve various old and honorable traditions, it is still good to see what can be improved, and you learned a number of things today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_390;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nThe location of one of the greatest warriors in the world -- the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] -- has been determined. You must seek out this champion and defeat them in an honorable duel.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_390;I must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_392;As you are passing through a village on your way to where the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] supposedly can be found one of the villagers is behaving very rudely, doing his best to get in the way of your horse so that you have to slow down and making several unflattering comments about you and your chosen attire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_392;Cut him down;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_392;Leave the village;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_393;You pull out your sword and cut the offensive man down with a single swift strike, as is your right as a warrior. Unfortunately, the other villagers appear to be horrified by your behaviour, and they demand that you leave the village at once as they do not want any further trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_393;I suppose I'd better leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_394;You draw your sword and cut the offensive man down with a single swift strike, as is your right as a warrior. The villagers nearby cry out in dismay, and soon a large number of guards surround you. After hearing what happened they demand that you pay a fine, as their customs apparently do not allow for a warrior to cut down a rude commoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_394;I'll pay your fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_394;I'll kill you all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_394;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_395;The guards that have surrounded you did evidently not anticipate that you would consider the possibility of fighting them, as they are completely surprised by your attack. By the time that the survivours start to recover you have already cut half of them down, and the other half does not put up significant resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_395;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_396;You attack the guards surrounding you, catching many of them by surprise, and the battle is already in your favor by the time that those that were the least surprised get close enough to fight back. It takes you a while to finish the fight, and you take a fairly minor wound in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_396;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_397;The guards are not particularly surprised by you electing to attack them, and they put up fierce resistance. The battle eventually turns in your favor, though you take a major wound during the fighting, and though you come out alive you conclude that it probably was a bad idea to decide to fight the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_397;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_398;The guards are ready for your attack, and you are wounded almost as quickly as you move to attack them. Though you do your best to avoid their blows and try your best to strike back at them, the battle does not go your way, and soon you find yourself lying on the ground, bleeding from a large number of lethal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_398;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_399;One evening when you are passing through a forest you hear the sound of several people speaking to one another nearby. You cannot make out what they are saying, and as far as you can tell they are not in your immediate vicinity, but you are evidently not alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_399;I will investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_399;I will investigate this... discreetly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_399;It is safest to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_400;As you move around a large boulder you locate the origin of the voices you heard. It seems a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are taking a bath together in a small pool in the forest and have been talking rather loudly while doing so. They have noticed your approach, and seem a bit surprised by your presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_400;Sorry to have bothered you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_400;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_401;You make your way towards the voices, moving carefully. As you crest a small hill you can see that a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are taking a bath together in a small pool in the forest, talking loudly while doing so. They do not appear to have noticed your presence yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_401;I'll not bother them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_401;I will ask to join them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_402;You make your way towards the voices, moving carefully, but you are not as careful as you would have liked as you trip over a branch and fall through a thick bush, ending face to face with a number of attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] that are taking a bath together, talking loudly to one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_402;Sorry, I took a wrong turn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_402;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_403;You abandon stealth and move towards the bathing [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] openly, deciding that they likely will be more willing to hear you out if you let them see you coming. They appear to be surprised by your presence, but they do not indicate that your presence is unwelcome as you approach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_403;May I join you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_404;The [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] taking a bath in the forest interrupt you before you are done trying to invite yourself to join them, telling you that it would be best for everyone if you turned around and kept walking. Though it was not what you wanted to hear, you decide not to press the issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_404;Fine! Be that way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_405;The attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] quickly invite you to join them in the small pool they are bathing in, and you waste no time getting out of your clothes and joining them. You all seem to have a good time bathing, and you start to wonder if it perhaps would be worth trying to take things further...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_405;I'll not push my luck...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_405;Who dares, wins!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_406;All of the attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] are open to the idea of you doing something rather more intimate than just bathing together, and you waste no time before getting started. The evening turns out in a most wonderful fashion for everyone involved, and you do not regret asking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_406;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_407;All but one of the attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] sharing a bath with you find your suggestion outrageous and quickly make excuses to leave. One of them lingers behind, however, and before long the two of you are engaged in activities far more intimate than just sharing a bath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_407;I suppose that was a success...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_408;The attractive young [Root.GetAttractiveBathingPeopleGender] you are sharing a bath with are not happy with your suggestion that the six of you should do something more intimate, and they hurriedly make excuses to leave and disappear before you can try to convince them that they should stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_408;I should not have tried...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_409;One day on the road you come across a preacher attempting to spread the word of the [preacher_province.Religion.GetName] faith to all who would listen. You are of course an adherent of the [Root.TrueReligion.GetName] faith, but perhaps there would not be any harm in listening to what the preacher is saying even so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_409;I'll listen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_409;I know the preacher lies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_410;There have been times during your journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] when you have misunderstood the information you have been provided about the distance to the next village, and you have sometimes had less food available than you are used to. This has not been as much of a problem as you once would have expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_410;I am fine eating less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_411;The roads you have been travelling have at times been rather poor, and even when they have been good you have sometimes been journeying up steep hills or otherwise had a harder time than normal. Though there have been times when you have considered taking another path, you are starting to do that less and less as your endurance has improved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_411;I feel stronger now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_412;One day on the road a group of armed men and women suddenly appear from all sides. They are dressed in mismatched outfits of fairly low quality, so you are fairly convinced that they are bandits, and you became more sure about that when they demand that you hand over all of your valuables if you value your life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_412;Ready your weapon and fight;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_412;Attempt to bribe them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_412;Attempt to flee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_413;The bandits that have surrounded you were clearly not prepared for an opponent as skilled as you, as they are taken completely by surprise when you attack them. Several of them fall before they can react, and though the rest of them attempt to fight back they are not even able to as much as wound you before they all fall.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_413;They stood no chance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_414;You manage to catch a few of the bandits by surprise and kill them quickly, but the others do not go down quite as easily. Though they are not particularly skilled at fighting, there are quite a few of them, and even though you come out on top they manage to wound you during the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_414;I suppose that went well enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_415;You do not really surprise the bandits by trying to fight them, and they manage to fight back quite well. It takes you more time than it probably should to come out on top, and though you eventually drive the last of the bandits off you have taken a rather vicious wound in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_415;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_416;The bandits are prepared for your attack, and you are wounded before you have readied your weapon. Though you do your best to make them reconsider what they are doing and manage to wound a few of them, the battle does not go your way, and before long you take a fatal wound, then another, and another...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_416;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_417;Though some of the bandits definitely appear to be of the opinion that they should take all of your valuables even if that means that they would have to fight you their leader is open to the suggestion that you willingly part with a comparably small sum of gold in exchange for them leaving you in peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_417;That was probably the right move...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_418;The bandits laugh at your suggestion that they should be satisfied with a smaller amount of money that you would willingly part with in exchange for them leaving you alone. Only two options remain open to you now, and you need to make your decision before it is made for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_418;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_418;Time to flee!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_419;Though you would have assumed that the bandits would be prepared for the possibility that you would attempt to flee instead of fighting them they are taken completely by surprise, and you have put quite some distance behind you and them by the time that they can react. They give chase for a while, but you eventually manage to lose them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_419;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_420;The bandits fail to prevent you from fleeing, though they give chase easily enough, and some of them have ranged weapons. Though you eventually get far enough away from them that they are forced to abandon the pursuit you have been injured a bit. You do not think any of the wounds are major, but they might still scar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_420;I suppose it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_421;You have passed through many villages on your way to the place where you have been told that the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] can be found, and the locals have often taken an intrerest in you. Today that interest was in the form of several young children who noticed your weapons and asked you if you would be willing to teach them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_421;Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_421;Sorry, but no...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_421;Oh, I will teach you a "lesson"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_422;The peasant children you agreed to give a quick lesson quickly picked up the basics that you initially had planned to teach them, and realizing that they might be ready to learn more you move on to more difficult things, which they also seem to get the hang of. Evidently they will be far more skilled warriors than you had thought possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_422;They had a good teacher!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_423;The peasant children seem to have played with wooden swords in the past, as they are not completely hopeless, but it still takes you quite some time to teach them what you would consider the essential basics that a warrior should know. They have improved a bit by the time you need to leave, but they are not particularly skilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_423;About what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_424;You had not expected the peasant children you agreed to teach to be particularly good at fighting, but you would at least have expected them to understand how to hold one of the wooden practice swords you instruct them to make. You do your best to teach them some of the basics, but you are unsure if they even managed to understand those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_424;I should have expected this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_425;The peasant children are eager to be taught a lesson by you and are caught completely by surprise when you disarm them one by one and give them a thrashing using your wooden practice sword. A couple of them attempt to fight back, but you disarm them again, and soon they are all running away, bruised, crying, and taught not to mess with their betters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_425;That concludes today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_426;As you are passing through yet another village on your journey you notice that there is a local festival of some kind going on. Investigating it, you discover that they will be holding an archery contest, and several of the villagers seem eager to compete against a foreigner as they offer to let you compete almost as soon as they spot you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_426;I'll compete!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_426;I'll not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_427;As the first round of the archery competition gets underway it becomes apparent that the villagers have a wide range of skills. Some of them are unable to shoot well enough to be able to hit anything close to their target, while others strike true time and time again. Your own skills are good enough that you are not yet disqualified.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_427;Time for the next round;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_428;The second round of the archery competition involves shooting at targets further away than those during the first round, and most of the villagers are not skilled enough to manage this. By the time that the round is over it is just you and one other archer that are left, and you expect the final round to be quite challenging.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_428;Time for the true test!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_429;The final round of the archery contest takes a long time to conclude, as you and your opponent seem quite close in skill. Eventually, you come out ahead as your opponent misses the centre of her target ever so slightly. She does not seem particularly upset, however, and gives you a quick curtsey, proclaiming that you have bested her fairly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_429;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_430;Though you do your best to win your skills are not up to the task, and you end up losing the archery competition. The winner, a young woman that apparently has done well past years too, is more skilled than nearly every archer you have seen before, as far as you can tell, so it is not overly shameful to have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_430;Time for me to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_431;As you are off travelling through foreign lands you have sometimes found it hard to get some kind of food that resembles what you are used to eating. There is often plenty of foreign cuisine to try, however, and it might perhaps be worth trying it out when you have the opportunity instead of insisting on something familiar that might cost more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_431;I'll try some new things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_431;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_432;You try several new kinds of food and quickly realize that it is quite good, and since you feel that you have been eating rather less than you normally would due to being reluctant to try new things you see no harm in having someone bring you some more of the things you liked. By the time you are satisfied you have eated quite a lot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_432;That was a nice meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_433;You try some new kinds of food, and you find that it tastes rather strange to you. Initially, you think that it probably is due to a lack of familiarity with the food in question, but as you force yourself to keep eating you start feeling more and more nauseous, and you have to fight to keep what you have eaten down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_433;This was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_434;One morning when you are riding through yet another village on your way to where you hope to face off against the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] a young man with a sword challenges you to a duel. Judging by how he is standing, he is a poor warrior, and as he keeps glancing over at several young women nearby you suspect he is trying to show off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_434;I will fight, and I will win!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_434;I'll just leave now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_435;As you had predicted, your opponent is quite bad, and you easily evade his strikes while testing his defenses. It is a simple enough matter to disarm him once you notice a few patterns, and now that you have beaten your opponent you get to decide what to do with him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_435;Compliment your opponent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_435;Give a salute and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_435;Humiliate your opponent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RISINGSUN_435;Kill your opponent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_436;One day on the road your horse loses one of its shoes by accident, and though it is easy enough for you to find a smith that would be able to re-shoe your horse in a nearby village he happens to be ill at the moment, forcing you to stay in the village for several days.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_436;An unfortunate delay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_437;Though you are confident that you and the rest of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are the greatest warriors in the world and that your way of warfare is quite good it is still useful to consider how a potential enemy might think. You feel that you have learned some useful things through discreet inquiries along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_437;I know their secrets now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_438;You enter yet another small village on the road towards the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] and find the situation quite tense. Inquiring about the situation, you learn that two prominent families have dragged nearly everyone into an ongoing feud of theirs. The villagers suggest that you could help settle the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_438;Certainly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_438;I don't want any part of this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_439;You meet with representatives from the first family shortly after agreeing to serve as an impartial judge, and they tell you about a number of terrible things that the other family has done. Some things sound rather outlandish, and at times the story is a bit jumbled, making it hard to say what actually might have happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_439;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_439;I suspect I am being lied to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_440;The second family's account of what happened does not match what the first family told you at all. The only real similarities between the two stories is that neither of them seem wholly coherent and that both of them definitely pain the other family in a bad light while those telling the story are portrayed positively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_440;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_440;I suspect I am being lied to...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_441;Knowing that you have heard what both sides have to say, the villagers are eager to hear your verdict. So far, it is not entirely clear to you whether either family's story is the truth, though perhaps it is possible to reach a decision even so if you think that you know enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_441;I need more time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_441;The first family is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_441;The second family is lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RISINGSUN_441;Both of them are lying!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_442;Though you caught both sides lying to you it still seems prudent to call out the first family alone as you feel that their lies were a bit more substantial. The second family is quick to thank you, and as you would rather not get involved any further in the matter you decide that it is time to leave the village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_442;I did the right thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_443;With the second family's story being a rather obvious lie, you decide to rule against them. The first family and their supporters are quite pleased, and though you feel that it would be prudent to leave the village quickly you are still confident that you have made a fairly good judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_443;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_444;The crowd that are listening to your verdict immediately starts shouting at each other when you reveal that both families lied to you, and it is not long before one villager decides to punch another village. Before long, the whole village is in chaos, and you decide to leave before someone tries to attack you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_444;They deserve each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_445;You meet with representatives from the first family again to discuss some things that you thought were unclear about their story. To your surprise, they admit that perhaps they might have been a bit untruthful and suggest that perhaps some coin would make you ignore that fact and would make you rule against the other family..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_445;I accept your payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_445;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_445;I will reveal this dishonesty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_446;You gather the villagers and declare that you have a verdict to make. The family you just spoke to seems happy at first, but as you publicly reveal that they just attempted to bribe you and that that makes it clear that they are not in the right their grins fade. You decide that you should leave the village right away to avoid potential retribution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_446;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_447;After being offered a bribe by the first family, you are not terribly surprised when the second family also offers a bribe to side against their opponent when you start questioning them about some flaws in their story. It would certainly not be honorable to accept a bribe, but it might still be a bit tempting to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_447;I accept your payment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_447;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_447;I will reveal this dishonesty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_448;You gather the villagers after speaking to the second family and declare that you have reached a conclusion due to the fact that bribery was attempted. You can see that both sides look a bit worried, but when you call out the side you just spoke to the other side's mood brightens, and they cheer you on as you take your leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_448;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_449;With both sides having told you stories that do not make sense and having attempted to bribe you, it is clear that you will not learn the actual truth, and it is time to make your verdict as the villagers are starting to become impatient and you really should continue your journey sooner rather than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_449;Side against the first family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_449;Side against the second family;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_449;Expose both as being dishonorable;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_450;As the bribe the first family offered was larger than the bribe offered by the second family you decide that they are the least honorable family, and you quickly rule against them. Though there are those that would say that you should have ruled against both sides, you feel that potentially ending the feud was more important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_450;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_451;The first family is quite displeased to learn that you will not rule in their favor despite the fact that you accepted their bribe, and some of them call you out on it. The second family seems a bit surprised by what just happened as you did not accept their bribe, but they are certainly happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_451;Money can't buy justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_452;Having accepted a bribe from the second family, you declare them to be in the right. The first family is definitely not happy, and you would have earned more money if you had sided with them, but it would perhaps have been more dishonorable to have done so or to have gone back on your deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_452;It was somewhat honorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_453;Both families are confident that you will rule in their favor when you gather the villagers together once more, seeing as they know that their side has bribed you. The first family's smiles disappear quickly when you declare that they are in the wrong, and some of them go as far as to call you a deal-breaker.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_453;Someone had to lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_454;Though both sides attemtped to bribe you and could have been ruled against based on that alone, you feel that there were more holes in the story the second family told you, and you rule against them based on that. The first family cheers you on as you depart the village, clearly satisfied with your judgement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_454;It was the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_455;As you accepted a bribe from the second family they seem confident that you will declare them in the right, but you quickly make them lose their smiles as you rule against them. The first family seems surprised about what just happened, seeing as you did not accept their bribe, but they are definitely happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_455;Money can't buy justice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_456;Since you accepted a bribe from the first family and turned down the bribe of the second family, you feel that you are bound to rule in favor of the first family. It is perhaps not as impartial a judgement as people would have expected, but you did make a deal, and it would be dishonorable to alter it....;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_456;It was somewhat honorable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_457;You accepted a bribe from both families, but with the first family paying you more you feel that it is right to take their side. The second family is most unhappy with this development, and several of them accuse you of being a deal-breaker as you prepare to leave the village, which is unsurprising.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_457;Someone had to lose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_458;Both of the families seeking a verdict from you told inconsistent stories, and both of them attempted to bribe you. The honorable course of action is abundantly clear, and you tell the assembled villagers that both sides are in the wrong. They do not take it well, and start fighting each other even before you can take your leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_458;You deserve each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_459;Having accepted a bribe, it would perhaps be reasonable to honor your agreement with the familiy in question, but you decide that it is more honorable to expose both families as being dishonest. The villagers quickly start shouting at each other, and it is not long before someone throws the first punch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_459;I should get going...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_460;Both families have paid you to rule against the other, and both clearly expect to be declared in the right. However, you decide that the most honorable cours of action would be to honor both agreements, and thus you rule against both families. A brawl breaks out as you are leaving the village to continue on your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_460;Both got what they paid for!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_461;One day on the road you come across a man dressed in clothes that probably were the height of fashion once but that now look rather worse for wear. He claims to be a local noble down on his luck, and when he learns of your heritage he is quite impressed and asks whether you would consider buying a family heirloom of his since he in in dire need of money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_461;I will buy your heirloom!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_461;I don't want it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_462;The man accepts your payment and hands over the heirloom quickly, even if you definitely sense some reluctance. He wishes you luck on your journey and takes his leave, and you wonder whether he will consider the trade worth it down the line or if he will come to regret lessing you his heirloom. Regardless of which it will be, you now possess it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_462;I hope I can find a use for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_463;Though it is doubtful that you would have been asked to prove yourself the most skilled warrior in the world if the Warriors of the Rising Sun did not believe in you, there might be approaches to fighting that you have never seen before. A skilled foreign warrior offers to teach you a few tricks one day, if you are willing to pay him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_463;This sounds useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_463;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_464;One day on the road the weather takes a turn for the worse, and soon you find yourself riding through heavy rain. You reach a village after a short while, and could definitely seek shelter there, but if you stay you might end up delayed noticeably as the roads could get worse, which you might be able to avoid if you keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_464;I must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_464;It is better to wait a while...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_465;Leaving the village behind you press on despite the rain. It is not the most pleasant journey you have had, and the roads keep getting worse as you continue, but eventually the weather clears and the roads start improving again. Given the state of the roads behind you, it was probably good that you kept going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_465;I made the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_466;You press on, leaving the village behind you. The downpour gets worse and worse, and your horse struggles to keep its footing from time to time. Though you eventually leave the worst of the downpour behind you and the roads improve a while after that, you are not sure that it was a good idea to keep going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_466;I feel unwell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_467;The route you are taking to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] requires passing through a mountain range, and as you are making your way through the mountain pass you had planned to use you find that the way ahead has been blocked due to a rock slide. It would perhaps be possible to climb over the rocks, but circling back might be safer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_467;I will press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_467;It would be best to circle back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_468;You dismount and start making your way past the rocks, leading your horse behind you. Though the path is somewhat treacherous, you are able to make your way to the other side of the fallen rocks without too much trouble, and the way ahead appears to be free of obstructions as far as you can see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_468;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_469;You dismount and start making your way past the rocks, leading your horse behind you. The path you take is rather treacherous, with the rocks shifting beneath you as you move, and though you eventually make it to the other side you have fallen several times and have been hurt in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_469;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_470;One day on the road you come across a strange party of travellers, nine in total. Stopping briefly to converse with their leader, you learn that they, too, are on a quest, seeking to bring about the end of some dark lord. To your knowledge, there is no such person, but perhaps they know something you do not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_470;Good luck!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_470;Beware the Black Riders!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_471;One night when you are sleeping at an inn in a small village along the road to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] you are awakened by the sound of someone moving nearby. Looking out through a crack between the shutters at the window, you can see several shadowy figures moving around, likely not planning to conduct any honorable business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_471;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_471;I must hide from them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_472;Being on the road without servants and with only a few different outfits with you has not always let you maintain the kind of appearance you would consider right an proper if you were back in [Root.Capital.GetName], and at times you wonder whether it actually is worth bothering to make the attempt as you keep getting dirty fairly quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_472;Being clean is important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_472;I should care less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_473;As you are having an evening meal in the inn of a small and unremarkable village you overhear several of the villagers discussing the subject of poetry. Apparently one of them fancies himself a poet, and the others seem appreciative of his poetry. Perhaps you should take the opportunity to share some poetry of your own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_473;I will share a poem!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_473;I have no interest in this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_474;The villagers are a bit surprised to learn that you are a poet, but they are willing to listen to you recite one of your poems. Once you are finished they express their appreciation of your work, and the villager with poetic aspirations states that it is clear that he could improve, though he does not seem particularly upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_474;I knew they'd like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_475;The villagers are a bit surprised to learn that you are a poet, but they are willing to listen to you recite one of your poems. By the time you are finished it is clear that they regret this decision, and several of them even go as far as suggesting that you should learn from their local poet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_475;They clearly know nothing of poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_476;Though your quest to seek out the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] currently is taking up all of your time, you have other aspirations as well that you sometimes have not pursued as diligently as you should have. Now you know the truth, and that truth is that these goals are worth pursuing simply because they will improve your standing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_476;Glory will be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_477;The quest to find the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] is taking up all of your time at the moment, and this has forced you to postpone several other plans you had. At first, you were reluctant to do this, but the journey has made you reconsider whether those goals actually matter enough that you should actively pursue them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_477;This is all I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_478;The journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] is taking longer than you initially had expected it to take, and though it at times have been interesting it is starting to become rather tedious. If you do not reach your destination soon, chances are you will need to vent your frustration in some other way than an honorable duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_478;Am I there yet?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_479;Being on the road means you no longer have to deal with various matters you would have to deal with if you were back home in [Root.Capital.GetName], and you feel yourself rather enjoying not having to meet with various people or do other kinds of work. Perhaps you should take time away from work more often?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_479;I should take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_480;As you are travelling by yourself you have been forced to interact with all manner of people you normally would not be interacting with back home in [Root.Capital.GetName], and though you occasionally have been unable to communicate well due to language differences you feel you have gotten better at understanding people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_480;This can only mean good things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_481;It is hardly surprising that the people living in the distant lads you are travelling through on your way to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] have different laws than those you are used to, but though you have tried to keep an open mind it has become clear to you that the laws of these savages are anything but just and honorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_481;I must ensure our laws are obeyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_482;You are quite familiar with the laws back home in [Root.Capital.GetName], and you have often heard that other cultures are backward savages because of them having different laws, but though you have noticed some different laws you have become unconvinced that they people following them are savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_482;Perhaps the law can be wrong?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_483;One day when you are passing through a village on your way to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] you notice that they are holding a local festival of some kind. Intrigued, you take a look around to see what goes on at a festival in this part of the world, and what you find is certainly different from anything you would see at a festival back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_483;They truly are uncultured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_483;It was quite interesting!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_484;You have seen many wondrous sights on your journey to the location of the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent], but even so you are taken by surprise when you one day see a celestial dragon moving across the sky, its serpentine body gleaming in the sun. Few can claim to have seen such a majestic creature in person.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_484;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_485;You have heard tales of strange beasts found in foreign lands in the past, but you have usually paid little attention to them as they have sounded rather fanciful. However, when you one day see a large winged creature fly past overheard you are forced to concede that perhaps the tales of fire-breathing dragons are true after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_485;I need to be careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_486;One day on the road nine figures completely shrouded in black come riding in the opposite direction. They all carry swords at their sides, and something about them puts you at unease. One of them asks you if you have seen the party of someone named "Shiribagin", who is in possession of something precious their lord lost long ago that he wants back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_486;I can't help you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_486;I might have seen them earlier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_486;Perhaps you should try Zeeland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_487;You have met your fair share of odd people on the road, but one day you meet a man calling himself a prophet that is stranger than most. Speaking in a rather melodramatic fashion, he declares that you need to ready yourself to face the onslaught of the Burning Empire, which apparently is coming to conquer all you hold dear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_487;What an odd man...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_487;He speaks the truth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_487;I am well aware!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RISINGSUN_487;They came, they saw, they LOST!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_488;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made you consider the Shinto religion more than you normally would, and you have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as you feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing, and few Warriors of the Rising Sun would disapprove of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_488;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_488;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_488;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_489;Being on the road on a quest for the Warriors of the Rising Sun has made you consider the Buddhist religion more than you normally would, and you have started to wonder if the time perhaps has come to convert to it as you feel that some of its teachings are rather appealing, and few Warriors of the Rising Sun would disapprove of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_489;I will convert!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_489;I will convert... secretly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_489;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_490;The Warrios of the Rising Sun are closely tied to Japan, and though a foreign warrior sometimes join the society and sometimes rise quite far it is harder to gain the respect of the other members if you are not Japanese, which you are quite aware of. Perhaps you should align yourself more closely with the society's values, and thus Japanese culture?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_490;I should become Japanese!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_490;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_491;There have been times on your quest to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] when you have felt uncertain as to whether embarking on your quest was a good idea, but you are starting to feel more and more certain that it is you made the right decision, and you feel certain that there is someone watching over you on your journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_491;[Root.TrueReligion.GetHighGodName] is with me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_492;Though things at times have gone well for you, you have sometimes felt as if your life lacked purpose, and at times the world has seemed to be against you. However, the journey to face the [Root.GetTheVeryBestOpponent] has given you purpose, and you are starting to feel that things perhaps are changing for the better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_492;Life isn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_493;One day when you are having a meal at an inn a foreign woman takes a seat on the opposite side of your table. Introducing herself as a Hermetic scholar somewhat down on her luck, she offers to share some of her supposedly vast knowledge with you in exchange for a rather modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_493;Tell me what you know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_493;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_494;As you are travelling in foreign lands you have often found yourself needing to ask for directions or needing to purchase maps of the area you are passing through. Though you would not go as far as to say that the locals are deliberately trying to mislead you, you sometimes end up having to backtrack, and that was the case today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_494;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_495;As you are travelling in foreign lands you have often found yourself needing to ask for directions or needing to purchase maps of the area you are passing through. Though you would not go as far as to say that the locals are extremely eager to help you, you sometimes have gotten quite good advice, and you have been able to take several shortcuts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_495;This is going well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_496;As you are passing through a thick forest you spot a group of people dressed in strange clothes standing together and chanting in some unknown language. They do not appear to have spotted you, but whatever they are doing it is filling you with unease, and you might perhaps want to intervene before they accomplish whatever they are trying to accomplish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_496;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_496;This does not concern me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_497;You attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize you are there. Their attempt to resist is quite feeble, and you easily kill all of those that do not run. When you mention what happened when stopping in a nearby village the villagers are upset, as you apparently interrupted an ordinary religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_497;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_498;You attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize you are there. Their attempt to resist is quite feeble, and you easily kill all of those that do not run. When you mention what happened when stopping in a nearby village the villagers are happy to hear that you stopped the ritual of a secretive local cult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_498;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_499;You attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize you are there. You take a few minor wounds when they fight back, but you eventually manage to kill all of those that do not run. When you mention what happened to some local villagers they are upset, as you apparently interrupted a perfectly normal religious ceremony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_499;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_501;You attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize you are there. You take a rather grievous wound in the fighting, but in the end you are triumphant.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_501;How could I have known?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_502;You attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize you are there.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_502;I only did what was right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_503;You attack the figures in the forest, cutting several of them down before they even realize you are there. However, they recover from their shock more quickly than you had anticipated, and you soon find yourself surrounded. Though you fight to the best of your ability, you are eventually overcome, and you fall to the ground, your vision fading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_503;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_504;One day you notice a rather curious sight next the road you are travelling on. A large bounder is located there, and a sword appears to somehow have been jammed into the boulder, with little but the hilt visible. Looking more closely at where the sword enters the stone, you cannot see how it could possibly have been put there in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_504;Attempt to pull the sword free;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_504;Keep riding;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_505;You reach out and grab the hilt of the sword easily enough, attempting to pull it free with all of your strength. It does not move noticeably, and despite giving it several more attempts you are unable to pull the sword free. Perhaps the parts of the sword you can see is all that there is, and it is firmly attached to solid rock?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_505;How odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_506;You reach out and grab the hilt of the sword easily enough, and you only need to make a token effort to pull it free. The blade is quite old, and you notice that whatever edge there once might have been long since has become dull. It would not be useful as a weapon, and since you prefer to travel lightly you see no real reason to bring it along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_506;I should put this back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_507;You have come across a number of abandoned ruins and strange structures during your journey, and in the past you have not paid much attention to them. However, today you came across a rather larger stone circle, and you started to wonder if it perhaps would be worth investigating it more closely to see what you might find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_507;I will investigate it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_507;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_508;The stone circle is clearly something of human origin, and it has clearly not been used for quite some time as it is mostly overgrown. Taking a look around, you do not spot anything obvious that would let you guess as to its original purpose, and even when you decide to remove some of the moss you find nothing of interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_508;That was a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_509;The stone circle is clearly something of human origin, and it has clearly not been used for quite some time as it is mostly overgrown. Taking a look around, you do not spot anything obvious that would let you guess as to its original purpose. When you remove some of the moss from one of the stones you find a depiction of two warriors engaged in a duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_509;Interesing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_510;One day you enter a village and overhear a herald proclaiming that there is a reward to be gained by the man or woman who can bring the head of a local bandit chief to the captain of the guard. Inquiring further, you learn that this bandit chief and his band of bandits has been causing the region a lot of trouble recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_510;I will hunt him down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_510;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_511;You spend several days searching for the bandits that supposedly are hidden near the village, but you do not manage to find any sign of them. Perhaps they have moved on to another area, seeing as they are being actively hunted, or perhaps they are exceptionally good at hiding. Reluctantly, you decide that it is time to depart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_511;I did my best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_512;By pure chance you stumble upon the bandits' trail, and you have no trouble at all following the trail to their encampment. As best you can tell, they are making preparations to depart, so if you do not choose to fight them it is very likely that they will slip away before anyone else can find them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_512;I will attack them right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_512;This is someone else's problem...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_513;Confident in their ability to hide, the bandits have not even posted sentries, and you are among them before they notice your presence. Several of them fall before they can pull their weapons free, and not even their chief puts up a fight. It is a simple enough matter to behead the man and disperse his followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_513;That was easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_514;The bandits have not seen fit to post sentries, but even so some of them spot you before you can get close to them, and they ready their weapons to fight you. The fighting is fierce, and you take a number of wounds, but eventually you manage to disperse them after beheading their leader..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_514;They fought well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_515;The bandits' sentries spot you as you make your approach, and you are quickly beset by them and the others. You take a number of wounds in the fighting, and the fight initially does not seem to go your way, but eventually you manage to kill their leader. The rest of them slip away, and you elect to return to the village for your reward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_515;That was far too close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_516;You move towards the centre of the bandits' encampment, readying your weapon. Though it appears as if you have not been noticed at first, you learn that you are mistaken when a volley of arrows suddenly comes right at you. Several of them hit their mark, and the bandits waste no time closing in for the kill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_516;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_517;One day you notice that someone has carved something into the wall of a cliff just to the side of the road. Investigating the carvings, you realzie that it is a depiction of a number of strangely dressed warriors fighting duels with one another, and though the rendition is largely artistic you still get some useful ideas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_517;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_518;Being on the road with only a handful of possessions on you have made you consider whether you actually need everything you have back home even when you are there. Though there are things that you own that definitely are useful, you conclude that one thing you do not need to have in excess is money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_518;I don't need money to be happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_519;There are times when you feel that there has been far too many things that you have been expected to do as both a ruler and a warrior, and though some of them might have been rather important it has been exhausting to have to deal with all of those things. Now that you have been on the road for a while you have finally been able to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_519;This journey was good for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_520;At the Edge of the Dunes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_520;It has been a long journey, but you have finally arrived at the supposed location of the Sword fo the Shifting Sands. Situated at the very edge of the Sahara Desert, the merchant city you have arrived at is larger than you had expected it to be based on what you heard before you arrived, and the people seem friendly enough despite the fact that you are an outsider.\n\nAsking the guards at the gate about the Sword of the Shifting Sands, you learn that the locals believe that the Sword can be found in one of the nearby oases and that you perhaps might find some help in the bazaar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_520;To the bazaar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_521;You start asking the merchants in the bazaar whether they know how to get to the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands. The first dozen or so you ask claim that they have no idea, but eventually you find a cartographer who has a map of the area for sale. He offers to sell it to you, but his price is rather steep.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_521;I'll buy your map!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_521;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_522;Shortly after leaving the cartographer's stand you are approached by a young boy dressed in clothes similar to those you have seen on various desert tribesmen. He says that he knows that you seek the Sword of the Shifting Sands as gossip regarding what you are up to has spread, and offers to guide you for a small sum of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_522;You're hired!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_522;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_523;Looking elsewhere in the bazaar, you learn of an old man that supposedly has guided caravans through the desert for nearly sixty years. It is easy enough for you to find him in a house nearby, and when you speak of the matter of the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands he offers his services as a guide in exchange for a modest amount of gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_523;You seem competent enough!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_523;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_524;Leaving the old man's house behind, you decide to head to a nearby inn for some quick refreshments. Suddenly a young woman with her face partially obscured by a veil sits down at your table, telling you that she has heard of where you wish to go. Apparently she has been to the oasis before and is on her way there, and she offers to bring you along.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_524;I will accompany you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_524;I'll get back to you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_525;You spend some more time asking around to see whether there are other options available, but after several hours and no new leads you are forced to conculde that there is nobody else that could guide you or that could sell you the relevant directions. You need to make a decision as to which choice you want to go with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_525;I'll buy the map;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_525;I'll hire the boy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_525;I'll go with the old man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RISINGSUN_525;I'll accompany the woman;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_526;You leave the city the next morning, with the map you purchased at hand and plenty of extra water. Unless the map you purchased is incorrect, it should be possible for you to travel from oasis to oasis until you reach your destination, and it should not take overly long to make this journey unless something unexpected happens along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_526;This should be easy enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_528;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_RISINGSUN_528;You arrive at the oasis where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly is to be found and discover that it is quite a bit larger than you would have expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present, you head there and enter through the surprising large gateway.\n\nInside, you find the veiled woman you met at the inn waiting for you, with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"I was starting to wonder if you had gotten lost," she tells you. "I know why you are here, but custom dictates you tell me, even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_RISINGSUN_528;You arrive at the oasis where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly is to be found and discover that it is quite a bit larger than you would have expected.

"Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_528;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_529;You and the young boy you hired agree to set off to the oasis of the Sword of the Shifting Sands in the morning, and you spend the rest of the day making preparations for the journey. The boy is waiting for you when you leave your room at the inn you have been staying at the next morning, seemingly impatient to depart from the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_529;He seems eager to please...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_530;You and your young guide have been on your way for several days and are heading through a ravine when an arrow comes flying past your head. Looking around you, you notice that several armed men have appeared in every direction, and that the boy who have guided you so far is nowhere to be found. It is not hard to figure out why that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_530;He led me into an ambush!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_531;With the element of surprise lost, the bandits are no match for you, and most of them die before the survivours conclude that they need to flee. You see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that you no longer have a guide you need to decide whether you want to try to get to the oasis on your own or if it is safer to fall back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_531;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_531;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
go_to_the_city;You will return to the city and make a new plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_532;The bandits fight hard and manage to wound you during the fighting, but the fight turns in your favor after a while and the survivours conclude that they need to flee. You see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that you no longer have a guide you need to decide whether you want to try to get to the oasis on your own or fall back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_532;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_533;The bandits fight hard, and you take a grievious wound in the fighting, but eventually the fight starts going your way and the remaining bandits turn around and flee. You see no reason to waste time riding them down, but now that you no longer have a guide you need to decide whether you want to try to get to the oasis on your own or fall back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_533;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_533;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_534;You fight hard, and several bandits fall before you, but they manage to inflict several wounds of their own and show no sign of being unwilling to continue fighting. It takes a while before it becomes clear which way the battle is going, but eventually it is clear that you will not be victorious, and you soon take a fatal wound...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_534;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_535;Leaving the site of the bandit ambush behind, you depart in the direction of what seems to be an oasis, only to discover that it is nothing but a mirage. Concluding that you are lost and should fall back, you do so, but after a while you find that your tracks have disappeared thanks to the wind, and with little water left there can only be one outcome...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_535;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_537;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_RISINGSUN_537;You arrive at the oasis where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly is to be found and discover that it is quite a bit larger than you would have expected.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_537;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_538;You and the old man you hired to guide you through the desert agree to depart the next morning, and he gives you a list of preparations you should make, such as making sure you have a good amount of water with you. By the time that you get to the old man's house the next morning you are having a good feeling about things, and he seems well prepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_538;Lead on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_539;One day when you and the old man are riding through the desert he suddenly cluches his chest and falls off his horse. Though he lands relatively gently in a sand dune you discover that his heart isnot beating and that his breathing has stopped. It seems his age finally has caught up to him, and as a consequence of this you no longer have a guide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_539;I can find the way on my own!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_539;I need directions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_540;Leaving the old man's body behind, you continue in the direction you were going, confident that you will be able to find the oasis you seek on your own. However, the arrival of a sandstorm later that afternoon makes you lose your sense of direction, and you are unable to find either a source of water or the way back to the city you departed from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_540;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCB_RISINGSUN_542;You arrive at the oasis where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly is to be found and discover that it is quite a bit larger than you would have expected. Noticing that an ornately decorated stone building next to the water is the only sign of human habitation present, you head there and enter through the surprising large gateway.\n\nInside, you find a young woman waiting for you, with a thin, curved sword in her hand and a small smile on her lips.\n\n"It seems I have a guest," she notes. "Tell me, why have you come here? Why have you sought out the Sword of the Shifting Sands?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_542;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_543;Having returned to the city at the edge of the desert, you find that there is nobody there that would be willing or able to guide you to your destination. The cartographer you spoke to earlier is however still willing to sell you the map that he offered you before for the same price he asked previously, so it seems as if there still is one option left.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_543;I guess I go with the map...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_543;I'd rather go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
fail_the_quest;Your quest will end in failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_544;The young woman smiles slightly when you accept her offer to lead you to the location of the Sword of the Shifting Sands and suggests that you should make sure that you get a good night's sleep and that you bring a lot of water. She asks you to meet her at the inn early the next morning, as she has some errands she needs to run before then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_544;I wonder why she seeks the oasis...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_545;As you and the veiled woman are making camp for the night in a smaller oasis on the way to the one where the Sword of the Shifting Sands supposedly can be found she suddenly leans in closely and plants a kiss on your lips, suggesting that perhaps the two of you could do something else during the rest of the evening than just engage in small talk over dinner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_545;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_545;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_545;I'm not really interested...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_546;You and your guide spend a rather enjoyable evening in one another's arms, with only a brief interruption to eat, and fall asleep together quite late, exhausted. Though you are a bit reluctant to get underway in the morning, you cannot stay where you are forever, and you have a quest to complete for the Warriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_546;We must press on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_547;Your companion takes your rejection well enough, and though you half expected things to get a bit strained between the two of you due to what happened your conversation over dinner is pleasant enough, and the same can be said for the one you have over breakfast the next morning. Maybe you have nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_547;Let's just keep moving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_549;The Sword of the Shifting Sands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_549;You and the veiled woman arrive at the oasis that supposedly is the home of the Sword of the Shifting Sands, and she guides you to an ornately decorated stone building at one side of the surprisingly large pool of water in the oasis.\n\nOnce inside, she disappears off to one side briefly and returns with a thin, curved sword in her hand.\n\n"It has been a while since someone came to seek me out," she tells you. "We both know why you are here, but I believe that it is customary for the guest to inform the host why they are there, so please take care of the formalities.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_549;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_551;You and the Sword of the Shifting Sands begin your duel by probing each other's defenses carefully, and your initial impression of her capabilities is that she knows what she is doing. It takes quite a while before the outcome starts to become apparent, but eventually you disarm her, and she declares that she yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_551;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_551;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_551;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_552;You and the Sword of the Shifting Sands begin your duel by probing each other's defenses carefully, and your initial impression of her capabilities is that she knows what she is doing. Though it takes quite a while before the outcome is clear she eventually gains the upper hand, and she puts the tip of her sword at your throat and asks you if you yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_552;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_552;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_553;Under the Sign of the Cross;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_553;You have arrived in the small town where the Sword of Christ supposedly has been seen in the past. It is rather unremarkable, in your opinion, and the only really notable thing about the town is a small abbey that is the home of an order of monks.\n\nYou question a few of the locals about the Sword of Christ when you arrive, but they claim that they cannot help you as the man only has visited the village infrequently in the past and his current location is uncertain. Hopefully, someone in the town is more informed than the average person, as it otherwise will be impossible to find the man you seek.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_553;Time to ask around...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_554;You ask around a bit more and are directed to speak to a man who apparently is a famous herald. He tells you that he believes he could track down the Sword of Christ for you relatively easily as he is known by many influential people nearby and thus could get answers you might not be able to get, but that his services are in high demand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_554;I will hire him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_554;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_555;Telling the herald that you will see if there are other offers before hiring him, you keep looking around the village for anyone that could help you out. To your surprise, a local child approaches you and suggests that perhaps the monks in the abbey know how to reach the Sword of Christ, seeing as he his a champion of Christianity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_555;I will speak to these monks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_555;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_556;You walk through the streets of the town looking for other options. Towards the edge of the town furthest away from the abbey, you notice that a building you initially took for an inn has a rather suggestive sign, and conclude that it probably is a brothel. Though the Sword of Christ is unlikely to visit it, the prostitutes might have information.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_556;I can ask here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_556;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_557;After going through the town one more time in the hopes of finding some other way to determine the location of the Sword of Christ you have concluded that the three options you have considered so far appear to be everything that there is, and you need to decide between them as delayingt he completion of your quest unnecessarily is unwise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_557;I will hire the herald!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_557;I will ask the monks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_557;I will ask at the brothel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_558;You hire the famous herald and he immeidately readies his horse to set off. A few of the locals are nearby and notice what is going on, and they tell you that the man probably is one of the most honorable people to be found nearby, so it seems unlikely that he is planning to ride off with your money without doing what he was hired to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_558;I hope he returns quickly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_560;The monks at the abbey are quite pleased to meet you and have evidently heard of you as they bring up the subject of the Sword of Christ before you can get around to it. They immediately offer to send one of their number to find the man in question, and you see no reason to turn down this offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_560;I knew they'd help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_561;The monks at the abbey are willing to speak with you despite the fact that you are not a Christian, but when you tell them that you seek the Sword of Christ they inform you that they are unwilling to send a message to him in the name of a heathen. They demand that you convert to Christianity if you wish for their help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_561;If I must...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_561;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_562;The monks are unhappy to learn that you are unwilling to convert, and they refuse to help you. As word likely will spread that the monks are upset with you, you conclude that you will have to act quickly if you wish to find the Sword of Christ, and that means you will have to hire the herald despite it being rather expensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_562;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_562;I'd rather go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_563;The owner of the brothel claims that she does not know anything about the Sword of Christ but that one of the prostitutes working there might know. She also tells you that she has a business to run, and that you will have to pay for the company of the prostitute in question even if you only want to ask her a question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_563;I suppose that's reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_563;I'll look elsewhere...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_564;You pay the necessary gold to hire the prostitute that the brothel's owner claims might know the answer to your question, and you are directed to one of the rooms at the brothel. Inside, you find a woman waiting for you, who starts undressing almost as soon as you enter the room, evidently not expecting you to be there for any unusual reason.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_564;I'm just here to ask a question!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_564;I can ask my question later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_565;The prostitute is surprised to learn that you merely want to know the location of the Sword of Christ, but she does not seem particularly unhappy by this. She tells you she is reasonably certain that she knows where the man in question can be found, and offers to send one of the maids to fetch him for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_565;She'd better hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_566;The prostitute is surprised to learn that you merely want to know the location of the Sword of Christ. She does not seem particularly unhappy by this, but she does not possess the information you seek. Given that you likely were seen entering the brothel the monks at the abbey are unlikely to be willing to help you, leaving you with just one option.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_566;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_566;I'd rather go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_567;You ask the prostitute about the Sword of Christ after sleeping with her, and though she seems rather surprised by the question she informs you that she is reasonably certain where he is. She offers to send one of the maids to fetch the man for you, and that seems like a reasonable idea to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_567;She'd better hurry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_568;You ask the prostitute about the Sword of Christ after sleeping with her, and she tells you that she does not know of the man. Given that it is very likely that you have been seen at the brothel, you doubt that the monks at the abbey would be willing to help you any longer, so if you want to find the man you seek you will have to hire the herald.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_568;I guess the herald will do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_568;I'd rather go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_569;Some days after your visit to the brothel you start to notice some discomfort when sitting down, and when you find a secluded place to undress you notice the signs of what you suspect is some kind of disease you picked up at the brothel, which probably is something you should have considered before sleeping with the prostitute you asked about the Sword of Christ.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_569;That's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_570;The Sword of Christ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_570;A few days after word was sent to the Sword of Christ one of the villagers comes running to fetch you, saying that the man in question has been sighted. You are led to one edge of the village and can see a man wearing an ornate suit of armor that is decorated with a multitude of crosses riding towards the village on a white stallion.\n\n"I assume it is you that requested my presence, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he says after a moment. "I suspect I know why you have come, but I would like to hear you say it even so.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_570;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_572;You and the Sword of Christ face off against each other in front of a large audience. Testing his defenses, you quickly determine that he will not be easily defeated. The duel remains undecided for quite some time, but finally you manage to get past his blade and put the tip of your sword at his throat, causing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_572;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_572;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_572;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_573;You and the Sword of Christ face off against each other in front of a large audience. Testing his defenses, you quickly determine that he will not be easily defeated. The duel remains undecided for quite some time, but then it goes against you very suddenly and you find yourself disarmed, with your opponent asking if you yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_573;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_573;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_574;A Land of Runes and Raiders;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_574;You have arrived at the location where the Sword of Winter supposedly can be found after a long journey. Though you know that there are Warriors of the Rising Sun that would use the word lightly, the people in this inhospitable part of the world definitely are savages, and it is a bit strange to you that a warrior that supposedly is one of the best in the world can be found here.\n\nThe locals shave expressed an interest in why you are there, but so far you have not found your opponent, and the only information you have gained so far is that you are looking for an older woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_574;I just need to ask around a bit more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_575;It takes you a while to find someone that knows where the Sword of Winter can be found, as she apparently is somewhat reclusive, but eventually a young warrior offers to guide you to her, telling you that she can be found in a place known as the Hall of Winter, which supposedly is located deep in the nearby forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_575;How quaint...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_577;In the Hall of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_577;You and your guide travel for a while before arriving at a large longhouse deep in the forest. Two fierce-looking warriors stand guard at the entrance, but neither of them moves to stop you from entering.\n\nInside, you find a number of warriors seated around a long table upon which a large feast has been laid out. At the far end there is an ornately carved throne, upon which a rather old woman is seated.\n\n"Ah, a challenger," she says when she notices you. "Since you so rudely have interrupted us in the middle of our meal, I request that you face off against some of my warriors before the two of us fight.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_577;I will take them all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_577;Only a coward would demand that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_578;The Sword of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_578;The woman's expression sours as you suggest that she might be a coward, and she stands up, drawing her sword.\n\n"A most rude guest indeed, it seems," she proclaims. "If not for the promise I made to the man who trained me, I would have you thrown out by my guards."\n\nShe walks over to an open area to one side of the table while the others present motion for you to join her, with those that were seated on that side of the table moving elsewhere to get a better view of the duel that is about to begin.\n\n"Shall we begin?" the woman asks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_578;Prepare yourself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_579;You have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon you, their weapons drawn. Though their assault is fierce, they are no match for someone as skilled as you are. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_579;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_580;You have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon you, their weapons drawn. Though their assault is fierce, and you are wounded in the fighting, but eventually you prevail. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_580;Time for the true fight...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_581;You have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon you, their weapons drawn. Their assault is fierce, and you take a grievious wound in the fighting, but eventually you prevail. The Sword of Winter watches with interest, but she does not seem overly concerned about her own chances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_581;This went rather poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_582;You have barely had time to agree to the Sword of Winter's request before the closest warriors are upon you, and they quickly overwhelm you.\n\n"It seems we shall not duel today, after all," the Sword of Winter tells you as your vision starts to fade. "I look forward to meeting you in Valhalla.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_582;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_583;The Sword of Winter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_583;"So, you are a good warrior after all," the Sword of Winter notes as she stands up, drawing her sword. "You managed to send all of my warriors to Valhalla despite being outnumbered, which definitely has earned you the honor of fighting me."\n\nShe moves over to an open area to one side of the now abandoned table at the centre of the longhouse, motioning for you to join her there.\n\n"It seems the Allfather himself will hear of this," the woman says, looking over to one side, where you can see that a raven is standing. "Ready yourself, and we shall see which one of us truly is the better warrior!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_583;Enough talk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_585;Despite her age, the Sword of Winter turns out to still be a formidable warrior, and you do not notice any obvious weaknesses you could take advantage of. The two of you exchange blows for some time before the fight eventually goes your way and you manage to disarm her. The Sword of Winter immediately yields when this happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_585;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_585;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_585;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_586;Despite her age, the Sword of Winter turns out to still be a formidable warrior, and you do not notice any obvious weaknesses you could take advantage of. The two of you exchange blows for some time before the fight eventually goes against you and she manages to disarm you. She tells you that she is willing to let you yield, if that is your desire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_586;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_586;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_587;The Empty Expanse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_587;You have followed the directions you were given to reach the location of the Sword of the Steppes and finally arrive at what should be the right location, upon which you notice a problem that should have been apparent sooner. The Sword of the Steppes is nowhere to be found, and neither is anyone else, since there was no permanent settlement for you to find.\n\nAs best you can tell, there is no obvious clue as to where the Sword of the Steppes and anyone with him have departed to, as they likely migrated quite a while back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_587;What do I do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_588;A few days have passed since you started looking for signs of nearby nomads. Before now, you have not managed to find any, but now you can see a rider approaching in the distance. Whether this rider has any particular interest in you or merely is curious is hard to say, but as you have not found anyone else to ask about the Sword of the Steppes you might as well speak to the rider.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_588;I will meet this rider...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_589;To your surprise, the rider asks you for your name once he is close enough to you to speak to you. Upon learning your name, he reveals that he has been sent to find you as the Sword of the Steppes has heard that you seek him and hopes to meet you as quickly as possible. The rider offers to guide you to your destination.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_589;Lead on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_591;The Sword of the Steppes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_591;Your guide leads you to a large nomad encampment, where the sentries let you pass without comment. You are quickly taken to the heard of the encampment, where a large number of warriors have gathered in a half-circle facing a fairly young man.\n\n"I was wondering how soon you would arrive," the young man says, slowly drawing his sword. "It has been a long time since one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun came to visit us, and it certainly is an honor. We both know why you are here, of course, but I still ask that you state it clearly.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_591;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_593;You draw your sword and move to engage the Sword of the Steppes, and the young man charges towards you as you do, driving you back several steps. Though it hard for you to gain the upper hand you eventually manage to find an opening in his defenses, and you put the tip of your sword at his throat, causing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_593;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_593;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_593;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_594;You draw your sword and move to engage the Sword of the Steppes, and the young man charges towards you as you do, driving you back several steps. You manage to deflect several blows, but eventually the man's sword slips past your defenses, with the tip coming to rest at your throat. The man asks if you yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_594;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_594;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_595;A Matter of Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_595;You arrive at the location where the Sword of the Dragon supposedly can be found, which is one of the largest cities you ever have seen, and evidently a busy one as there are many other travellers arriving at the same time as you.\n\nThe guards at the gate inquire as to whether you have come there, and when you tell them that you seek the Sword of the Dragon they tell you that those that seek that man need to speak to one of the local government officials, who apparently can be found in one of the large buildings overlooking the central market of the city.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_595;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_596;You arrive at the building you were told to seek out and quickly manage to arrange for a meeting with the man who supposedly is in charge of matters concerning the Sword of the Dragon. He tells you that many come there for the same reason and that all have to take a test to prove their worth, unless they would rather pay to skip it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_596;I'll pay you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_596;I'll take the test!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_597;Despite the fact that the man asks for quite a lot of money you are unwilling to waste time on a test that apparently has nothing to do with fighting, and you agree to pay him to avoid it. Doubtlessly, there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun who will be displeased by this, but you still think you have made the right decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_597;I'm sure people will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_599;The first part of the test you have to take consists of making a written statement explaining in detail why you deserve to face off against an opponent as auspicious as the Sword of the Dragon. You would have thought that your reputation would have preceded you, but apparently it is insufficient to convince the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_599;I think my statement was good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_600;The second part of the test consists of a number of questions regarding the Art of War, some of them trivially easy, others quite challenging. As you have discussed warfare with others in the past you are not entirely unprepared, and you feel like your answers might be good enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_600;I think I got it right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_601;The third part of the test appears to have nothing to do with the Sword of the Dragon, warfare, or other matters that could be relevant, since it asks you a number of questions regarding how a ruler should govern their realm. You ask the person that handed it to you whether he made a mistake, and he tells you you got the right test.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_601;This was a rather odd test...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_602;The fourth part of the test contains a number of riddles, which is a rather odd subject as far as you are concerned, but seeing as the previous test also was rather unrelated to the matter at hand you are not entirely surprised. Several of the riddles are rather tricky, but you eventually arrive at decent answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_602;This was rather tricky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_603;The fifth and final part of the test is a number of questions regarding notable Chinese works. As with the previous two tests, it does not seem wholly relevant, but you are assured that these are questions they want you to answer before you may meet with the Sword of the Dragon, and you eventually manage to answer all of the questions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_603;I hope I get the results soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_605;The official you spoke to first comes to speak to you a few hours after you handed in your answers, revealing that they have been deemed acceptable and that a messenger has been sent to the Sword of the Dragon, who apparently is elsewhere at the moment. You are offered a room to stay in until your opponent arrives, which you see no reason to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_605;I hope he arrives soon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_606;The official you spoke to first comes to speak to you a few hours after you handed in your answers, tellrevealing that your answers were not good enough to warrant a duel with the Sword of the Dragon. You will either have to pay for the duel to be arranged or have toleave without issuing your challenge, thus failing in your quest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_606;I guess I have to pay...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_606;I'd rather go home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_607;The Sword of the Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_607;It takes some time before word comes back that the Sword of the Dragon is on his way to the city where you are waiting for him, and he is still several days away when that happens, but eventually you are asked to accompany the local bureaucrats outside to meet the man.\n\nAs you exit the building you can see a large column of soldiers approaching the front steps, led by a single rider on a fine horse. He raises a hand to bring the soldiers to a halt and dismounts, walking over to you.\n\n"I suspect that it is you that have summoned me," he says. "Tell me, what do you want?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_607;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_609;Though the Sword of the Dragon arrived accompanied by a large number of soldiers you did not initially expect him to be a good warrior, but you learn otherwise while you are fighting him, as he is a skilled opponent. However, though he fights well he is not good enough to defeat you, and you eventually manage to disarm him, causing him to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_609;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_609;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_609;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_610;Though the Sword of the Dragon arrived accompanied by a large number of soldiers you did not initially expect him to be a good warrior, but you learn otherwise while you are fighting him, as he is a skilled opponent. You think you might be able to prevail at first, but eventually he manages to disarm you, upon which he asks you if you will yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_610;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_610;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_611;A Land of Many Gods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_611;The location you were told to head to in order to find the Sword of Serpents is deep in the jungles of India, which seems like a rather strange place for a renowned warrior to be located, but based on what information you have managed to obtain on your way there the man is indeed found somewhere in the jungle, and is supposedly some kind of madman in addition to being a skilled warrior.\n\nUpon arriving at the location you have been told to go to, you find that there is nothing there except for a rather small village, which is strange since you have heard that the Sword of Serpents lives in a grand place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_611;I hope I'm not in the wrong place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_612;After speaking to the villagers you are given directions to the true location of the Sword of Serpents, which apparently is an ancient temple deeper into the jungle. The villagers tell you that they do not really understand why anyone would want to live there, but as you have heard that he is a madman it does not surprise you overly much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_612;I suppose I will head there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_614;In the Heart of the Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_614;The journey through the jungle to the old temple where the Sword of Serpents supposedly can be found is rather difficult, and it takes you several days to get to your destination, which turns out to be a bit grander than you expected it to be.\n\n"Welcome!" a voice calls out from one of the upper levels, where you can see a man standing on a balcony. "You must be here to fight me!" He laughs a bit before continuing. "You will have to pass through the challenges inside to reach me!"\n\nWith that, he disappears inside, letting out yet another laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_614;Let's see what is inside...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_615;The first few rooms inside are empty, and you start to wonder if there truly are challenges as you go through them. However, as you reach the base of a large set of stairs you notice that what you initially thought was a bunch of vines covering the stairs instead is a number of hooded snakes, which doubtless are not going to be friendly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_615;I can get past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_615;I think I'll go home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_616;You start making your way up the stairs, moving as carefully as you can between the snakes. Unfortunately for you, you are not careful enough, and the snakes soon make their displeasure known. Though you attempt to fend them off with your sword, several of them still manage to bite you, and you collapse to the ground, your vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_616;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_617;You start making your way up the stairs, moving as carefully as you can between the snakes. Though they do not seem entirely pleased to have someone move past them, they do not attack you, and eventually you manage to reach the top of the stairs, entering a snake-free passage leading elsewhere in the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_617;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_618;You pass through several more empty rooms before reaching the next set of stairs. At first, it looks as if there is nothing special to be found there, but when you accidentally kick a small rock over towards the base of the stairs a small section of the floor drops down and an arrow flies past you. Evidently, the room is trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_618;I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_618;This is too dangerous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_619;You study the floor and the stairs carefully before you start moving, taking note of anything that looks like a pressure plate. Though you get quite far without a misstep you eventually make a mistake, and an arrow hits you in the shoulder. It has evidently been posioned as you feel your strength fading, and as you fall you trigger several more traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_619;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_620;You study the floor and the stairs carefully before you start moving, taking note of anything that looks like a pressure plate. Several of them are hard to make out, and you almost step in the wrong place a number of times, but you successfully make your way across the room and up the stairs, and the room above is free from traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_620;Next challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_621;As you continue through the temple you notice that there no longer appears to be just one way forward, and you start to suspect that you have entered a labyrinth. Given the sheer size of the temple, it is likely very extensive, and if you got lost it is not certain that you would be able to find the exit again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_621;I can do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_621;I won't do this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_622;You begin making your way through the labyrinth, doing your best to remember which way you turn at each intersection. The temple is large enough that it takes you several hours before you conclude that you are lost, and though you try to find your way out of the labyrinth you are unsuccessful to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_622;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_623;You begin making your way through the labyrinth, doing your best to remember which way you turn at each intersection. Just as you start wondering whether you have gotten lost you find yourself at the base of a grand staircase, and at the top of it you can see a pair of ornately decorated doors, which likely lead to where your opponent waits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_623;That wasn't so bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_624;The Sword of Serpents;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_624;You push the ornate doors open and go through the doorway, finding yourself in a large chamber containing a number of large statues of men and women clad in elaborate clothing of unknown significance. You can see the Sword of Serpents sitting with his legs crossed towards the opposite side of the room, and he looks up expectantly as you draw closer.\n\n"You're here!" the madman exclaims, jumping to his feet. "People said that it was a stupid idea to add the snakes, and the pressure plates, and the labyrinth, but I knew I was right!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_624;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_626;Despite the fact that the Sword of Serpents is something of a madman, he clearly knows how to fight, and his style incorporates a large number of feints. However, eventually you manage to make out a pattern, and you beat his sword aside with yours and put the tip of yours at his throat. The Sword of Serpents immediately yields.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_626;Well fought, and farewell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_626;You should join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_626;And now you die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_627;Despite the fact that the Sword of Serpents is something of a madman, he clearly knows how to fight, and his style incorporates a large number of feints. You manage to fend him off for a while, but eventually he gets through your defenses, and you find yourself with the tip of his sword at your throat. He asks if you wish to yield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_627;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_627;I'd rather die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_628;You have finally returned home from your journey to seek out one of the greatest warriors in all the world. Perhaps you will find reason to journey somewhere else in the future, but for now you need to take care of various matters at home that have come up in your absence, which doubtlessly will take you some time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_628;Home, sweet home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_629;A Challenge at Home;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_629;One uneventful day one of your servants comes running, telling you that an old man has arrived and is requesting to meet you. You decide to grant the man an audience, and when he enters you notice that he is armed and definitely walks as if he knows how to fight.\n\n"At last we meet," the man says. "You have travelled across the land, searching far and wide, and have defeated all six of my most promising students. You certainly show promise, but if you wish to prove that you truly are the very best warrior around you must face me now, in a duel to the death.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_629;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_629;I would rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_631;The Undisputed Champion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_631;You and the Unknown Master draw your swords as a crowd is gathering around you and slowly move closer to one another, taking note of every detail of each other's movements. The initial attacks from both of you are very careful, as are the initial moves you make to deflect those attacks, and it is clear that the duel will not be decided quickly.\n\nYou are pressed to your limits by your opponent, but eventually the duel starts going your way, and you inflict a number of small wounds on your opponent before finally beheading him with one swift strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_631;I am the very best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_632;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] finally has managed to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] the very best warrior in all the world, defeating seven skilled opponents in the process. It is doubtful that anyone else will be given the opportunity to do something similar while [From.GetBestName] still lives, so the achievement is unlikely to be matched anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_632;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_RISINGSUN_633;A Final and Fatal Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_633;You and the Unknown Master draw your swords as a crowd is gathering around you and slowly move closer to one another, taking note of every detail of each other's movements.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_633;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_634;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] has failed in [From.GetHerHis] quest to prove that [From.GetSheHe] is the best warrior in the world. Doubtlessly, someone else will get the opportunity to do so in the future, but one thing is clear, and it is that the Warriors of the Rising Sun were wrong to put their faith in the skills of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_637;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetBestName],\nThe Warriors of the Rising Sun appear to have been wrong to put their faith in you and your skills, as you have failed to prove that you are the best warrior to be found.
