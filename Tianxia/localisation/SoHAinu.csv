EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_1;Before I can invite my vassals to the Iyomante I need to ensure that certain preparations have been taken care of. It should not take overly long to get them out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_1;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_2;When sending a kamuy back Kamuy Mosir, it is traditional to offer up plenty of wooden nusa. Of course, it is possible to offer just a single inaw if I think that it is unreasonable to do something else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_2;The kamuy deserves plenty of nusa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_2;A reasonable number of nusa is appropriate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_2;We just need a single inaw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_3;In addition to nusa, sake is to be offered to the kamuy when sending it back to Kamuy Mosir. How much sake do I want to ready for this purpose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_3;The kamuy shall have plenty of sake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_3;I think a moderate amount is reasonable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_3;I will give it the bare minimum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_4;The guests coming to the Iyomante will of course expect me to provide food prior to the sacrifice. I need to decide how much I should spend on that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_5;With the preparations taken care of, I can finally send out the invitations to my various vassals. I hope that they will be able to come to my Iyomante.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_6;[Root.GetTitledName]\n\nI hereby invite you to my Iyomante and hope that you will be able to attend. It is time for us to return a kamuy to Kamuy Mosir!\n\nBest regards,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_6;I'll be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_6;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_7;[Root.GetTitledName],\n\nI have made other plans and will not be attending your Iyomante.\n\nBest regards,\n[From.GetTitledName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_8;The guests are finally arriving at my Iyomante, and the bear that I have been raising has been appropriately tied up for the sacrifice. The celebration can finally begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_8;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_9;I have finally arrived at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante, as have many other guests. As best I can tell, everything is ready for the celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_9;I hope it will be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_11;[From.GetBestName] really seems to have gone out of [From.GetHerHis] way to ensure that there is plentiful and varied food at [From.GetHerHis] Iyomante.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_11;This pleases me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_11;An unnecessary expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_11;I suppose it is nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_12;The food provided at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante is neither the most varied nor the most plentiful I have experienced, but it is clear [From.GetSheHe] has put some effort into it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_12;[From.GetSheHeCap] could have done more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_12;[From.GetSheHeCap] spent too much on the food!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_12;I suppose it was a reasonable decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_13;Though [From.GetBestName] has made sure that there is food available at [From.GetHerHis] Iyomante, it is neither plentiful nor particularly varied.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_13;It shows good judgement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_13;[From.GetSheHeCap] should have done more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_13;I suppose it is reasonable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_14;[From.GetBestName] seems to have found my decision regarding the food to be served at the Iyomante to have been a good one, as [From.GetSheHe] has been expressing [From.GetHerHis] appreciation of it quite loudly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_14;That's good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_15;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not approve of the amount or quality of the food served at the Iyomante, as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard complaining about it rather loudly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_15;[From.GetSheHeCap] should shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_16;As the Iyomante goes on I find myself spending some time with [iyomante_friend.GetBestName], a rather fascinating [iyomante_friend.GetManWoman], and I find that we have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_16;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_17;I have the opportunity to spend some time getting to know [From.GetBestName] at [From.GetHerHis] Iyomante, and I really feel that we have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_17;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_18;I find myself spending spending quite some time with [iyomante_friend_character_2.GetBestName] at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante, and we turn out to have quite a few things in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_18;We should be friends!
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_19;I and [iyomante_friend_character_1.GetBestName] have an opportunity to spend some time together at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante, and it turns out we have a lot in common.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_19;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_20;It seems [iyomante_friend_character_1.GetBestName] and [iyomante_friend_character_2.GetBestName] have grown quite a bit closer during the Iyomante, seeing as they both have loudly proclaimed their friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_20;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_21;At [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante I have the displeasure of spending time with [iyomante_rival_character_2.GetBestName], a thoroughly unpleasant [iyomante_rival_character_2.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_21;I really hate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_22;It seems [iyomante_rival_character_1.GetBestName] is at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante. [iyomante_rival_character_1.GetSheHeCap] really is an unpleasant [iyomante_rival_character_1.GetManWoman], and I really do not enjoy being in their presence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_22;In fact, I hate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_23;Two of my guests, [iyomante_rival_character_1.GetBestName] and [iyomante_rival_character_2.GetBestName], really do not seem to be enjoying each other's company, and all attempts to make them get along seem to have failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_23;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_24;As the Iyomante continues one of my servants comes running, screaming that the bear has escaped. Though I did not tie it up myself, it is an embarrasment to me to not have a bear available at the Iyomante.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_24;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_25;I am having a good time conversing with some of the other guests at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante when a servant comes running, screaming that the bear that was due to be sacrificed has escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_25;What an embarrasment!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_26;I am conversing with some of the guests at the Iyomante when I suddenly hear someone cry out in pain outside. Running out, I discover that [iyomante_wounded_guest.GetBestName] has been wounded by the bear, which somehow has gotten loose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_26;Make sure it is tied up properly this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_27;As I am walking around some distance away from the main celebration at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante to get some fresh air I hear movement behind me. Turning around, I find the bear that's due to be sacrificed standing there, clearly not tied up. I manage to get away from it quickly enough, but not without being wounded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_27;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_28;As the Iyomante continues the celebration is briefly interrupted by the sound of screaming. I and several others head to investigate it, and it turns out the bear has gotten loose and has attacked [iyomante_wounded_guest.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_28;I hope it is tied up properly this time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_29;One of my servants informs me that the bear at the Iyomante apparently had not been tied up properly as it somehow got loose. Luckily, it did not wander off or hurt anyone, and it has been tied up properly now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_29;That could have been bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_30;One of [From.GetBestName]'s servants brings word that the bear at the Iyomante had gotten loose, but that it has been tied up properly now. Nobody was hurt in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_30;That could have been bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_31;The bear that [From.GetBestName] has raised for [From.GetHerHis] Iyomante is very large, and it looks as if it has been fed quite well indeed. I have certainly seen much less impressive ones elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_31;Most impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_32;It seems [From.GetBestName] really thinks that the bear at my Iyomante is impressive. I have of course seen to it that it was well fed and taken care of, and it is good to know that that is appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_32;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_33;The bear at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante is rather unimpressive compared to others I have seen in the past. It is as if [From.GetBestName] has not been taking proper care of it, which is unlikely to please the kamuy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_33;It is a rather disappointing sight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_34;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not think much of the bear at my Iyomante as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard complaining about how small it is and how it does not look anything like those [From.GetSheHe] has seen before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_34;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_36;As the sending off of the bear is about to begin [bear_sacrifice_child.GetBestName] comes running and demands that I call of the sacrifice, claiming that the bear is as a sibling to [bear_sacrifice_child.GetHerHim] and that [bear_sacrifice_child.GetSheHe] will never forgive me if I kill the bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_36;I suppose you can have the bear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
iyomante_bear_saved;The bear will be given to [bear_sacrifice_child.GetBestName]. There will be no sacrifice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_36;The sacrifice will continue as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_37;As the bear is about to be sent off to Kamuy Mosir [bear_sacrifice_child.GetBestName] comes running and demands that [From.GetBestName] lets [bear_sacrifice_child.GetHerHim] keep the bear. To my surprise, [From.GetBestName] agrees to this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_37;That's unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_38;As the bear is about to be sent off to Kamuy Mosir [bear_sacrifice_child.GetBestName] comes running and demands that [From.GetBestName] lets [bear_sacrifice_child.GetHerHim] keep the bear. It is hardly surprising that [From.GetBestName] refuses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_38;The child will understand, one day...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_39;The sending off of the bear is about to begin, and it is time to decide who will be allowed to take the first shot at the bear. Every eye will be on the archer, and they will hopefully not make a fool of themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_39;I will take the first shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_39;A vassal will take the first shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_39;A courtier will take the first shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_40;Having decided to take the first shot myself, I ready my bow and take position not too far from the bear. As it is tied up, it is hardly a difficult target to hit, and my arrow strikes true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_40;An easy shot!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_41;As the sending off of the bear begins [From.GetBestName] takes the first shot at the bear. Missing the shot would have been quite embarassing, seeing as the bear is tied up, and [From.GetBestName]'s arrow easily finds its mark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_41;Not very surprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_42;Having decided to take the first shot myself, I ready my bow and take position not too far from the bear. Despite the fact that the bear is tied up my shot goes wide, causing some of the people behind me to let out a laugh.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_42;I meant to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_43;[From.GetBestName] decides that [From.GetSheHe] will get to take the first shot and readies [From.GetHerHis] bow. I would have expected it to have been an easy shot, seeing as the bear is tied up, but [From.GetBestName] still somehow manages to miss the bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_43;How embarassing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_44;I have been given permission to be the first to shoot an arrow at the bear being sacrificed at [From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante. As soon as the servants have fetched my bow, I take position near the bear and loose my arrow, which strikes true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_44;It would have been embarassing to miss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_45;I give [From.GetBestName] permission to shoot the first arrow at the bear, and though we have to wait for the servants to fetch [From.GetHerHis] bow [From.GetSheHe] has no difficulty hitting the bear with [From.GetHerHis] arrow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_45;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_46;[FromFrom.GetBestName] gives [From.GetBestName] permission to be the first to shoot an arrow at the bear that is being sacrificed, and once [From.GetHerHis] bow has been fetched by the servants [From.GetBestName] easily fires an arrow at the bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_46;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_47;[From.GetBestName] gives me the right to fire the first arrow at the bear to be sacrificed at the Iyomante, and I do not expect any trouble since it is tied up. However, my shot somehow goes wide even so, and I can hear someone laughing behind me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_47;I meant to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_48;I give [From.GetBestName] the right to fire the first arrow at the bear, expecting it to be an easy shot for [From.GetHerHim]. To my surprise, and likely the surprise of others present, the shot goes wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_48;How embarassing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_49;[FromFrom.GetBestName] gives [From.GetBestName] the right to fire the first arrow at the bear being sacrificed at the Iyomante, and it should be an easy shot seeing as the bear is tied up and is being shot at from short range. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] is a poor enough archer to still miss the bear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_49;How embarassing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_50;With the bear weakened from the many arrows I step up to it and cut its throat in one swift motion. Blood pours forth, and I and many of my guests drink it, as is appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_50;Thank you, kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_51;The bear at the Iyomante has been weakened from the many arrows that has hit it, and [From.GetBestName] finally steps up to cut its throat. I and many of the other guests come forward to drink its blood, as is appropriate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_51;Thank you, kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_52;As soon as the bear at the Iyomante has been sufficiently weakened by the arrows being shot at it [From.GetBestName] steps up to it and cuts its throat. [From.GetSheHeCap] and many of the Ainu guests then see fit to drink its blood, thanking the kamuy once they are finished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_52;How barbaric!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_52;These Ainu customs sure are strange...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_52;A curious ritual...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_54;With the bear dead it is time to offer up the nusa that have been prepared. I send some of my servants to bring them out, and my guests really seem impressed by the quantity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_54;For you, kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_55;With the bear dead [From.GetBestName] sends [From.GetHerHis] servants to bring out the nusa that have been prepared to be offered to the kamuy. It turns out that a very large quantity has been prepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_55;An impressive offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_56;With the bear dead it is time to offer up the nusa that have been prepared. My servants bring them out, and my guests seem to find the number quite adequate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_56;For you, kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_57;With the bear dead [From.GetBestName] sends [From.GetHerHis] servants to bring out the nusa that have been prepared to be offered to the kamuy. They bring out an amount that is neither extravagant nor underwhelming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_57;A good offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_58;My guests seem rather upset when I send my guards to bring out the single inaw that is to be offered to the kamuy. Clearly, they had expected more than that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_58;I'm sure the kamuy will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_59;With the bear dead, I would have expected [From.GetBestName]'s servants to have brought out a good number of nusa to offer to the bear. However, to my surprise, and the surprise of many other guests, only a single inaw is offered to the kamuy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_59;That's all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_61;It is time to offer sake to the kamuy, and I instruct my servants to bring out the sake that has been readied for this purpose. Several of my guests look quite impressed when they see how much sake I am offering up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_61;For you, kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_62;[From.GetBestName] has [From.GetHerHis] servants bring out the sake to be offered to the kamuy, and the amount they bring out is quite substantial. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] wants the kamuy to be pleased by the offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_62;An impressive offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_63;It is time to offer sake to the kamuy, and I instruct my servants to bring out the sake that has been readied for this purpose. My guests seem to find the amount that has been prepared to be adequate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_63;For you, kamuy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_64;[From.GetBestName] has [From.GetHerHis] servants bring out the sake to be offered to the kamuy, and the amount they bring out is roughly what would be expected. I doubt the kamuy will be displeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_64;A good offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_65;It is time to offer sake to the kamuy, and I instruct my servants to bring out the sake that has been readied for this purpose. My guests look rather upset when they see that I am not going to offer any significant quantity of sake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_65;I'm sure the kamuy will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_66;[From.GetBestName] has [From.GetHerHis] servants bring out the sake to be offered to the kamuy, and they come out with an amount that is laughably small. It seems [From.GetBestName] does not care to make an appropriate offering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_66;That's all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_67;With offerings made to the kamuy it is time to distribute the bear's meat. Traditionally, everyone is supposed to get some, but the decision is ultimately up to me, and I could choose to give it to someone specific.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_67;Everyone will get some!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_67;I'll give everything to a vassal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_IYOMANTE_67;I'll give everything to a courtier!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_IYOMANTE_67;As if I would share it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_68;With offerings having been made to the kamuy [From.GetBestName] starts distributing the meat from the bear. Customarily, everyone would get some of it, and [From.GetBestName] is definitely making sure that that is what happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_68;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_69;As [From.GetBestName] finishes the offerings to the kamuy it is time for [From.GetHerHim] to distribute the meat. Custom would dictate that everyone gets some of it, but it becomes clear that [From.GetBestName] has other plans as [From.GetSheHe] gives it all to me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_69;How generous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_70;As [From.GetBestName] finishes the offerings to the kamuy it is time for [From.GetHerHim] to distribute the meat. Custom would dictate that everyone gets some of it, but it becomes clear that [From.GetBestName] has other plans as [From.GetSheHe] gives it all to [iyomante_meat_recipient.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_70;This isn't right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_71;As [From.GetBestName] finishes the offerings to the kamuy it is time for [From.GetHerHim] to distribute the meat. However, it quickly becomes clear that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in following tradition as [From.GetSheHe] orders [From.GetHerHis] servants to put the meat away so that [From.GetSheHe] can eat it later on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_71;This isn't right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_72;My Iyomante will not involve a bear being sent off this time, which certainly is unexpected. My guests and I will have to do something else to pass the time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_72;At least we have sake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_73;[From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante will not involve a bear being sent off this time, which certainly is unexpected. I and the other guests will have to figure out some other way to entertain ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_73;At least we have sake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_74;The sake at the Iyomante was quite plentiful, and I drank a lot of it last night. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but as I woke up this morning I really started to have second thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_74;That... was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_76;The bear is dead and offerings have been made. At my command, the servants mount the skull on top of a spear and wrap the spear in the bear's fur, mounting the result in such a fashion that it looks to the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_76;It has been sent off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_77;The bear is dead and offerings have been made. At [From.GetBestName]'s command, the servants mount the skull on top of a spear and wrap the spear in the bear's fur, mounting the result in such a fashion that it looks to the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_77;It has been sent off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_78;As the festivities at the Iyomante continue I have the opportunity to recite a yukar. Doing it well would impress my guests, but if should fail to recite it properly it would be rather embarassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_78;Of course I will recite a yukar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_IYOMANTE_78;I think I'll pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_79;I call for my guests to come closer so that they can hear me and begin reciting the yukar. I speak at length about Ainu Mosir, the Land of the People, and Kamuy Mosir, the Land of the Kamuy. When I finish, the guests start applauding, clearly impressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_79;I'm quite good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_80;[From.GetBestName] calls for everyone at the Iyomante to gather around [From.GetHerHim] and then starts reciting a yukar. [From.GetSheHeCap] speaks at length about Ainu Mosir, the Land of the People, and Kamuy Mosir, the Land of the Kamuy, in a fashion that is both accurate and interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_80;Impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_81;I call for my guests to come closer so that they can hear me and begin reciting the yukar. I speak at length about Ainu Mosir, the Land of the People, and Kamuy Mosir, the Land of the Kamuy. The guests seem to find my performance decent, if not impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_81;I suppose I can live with that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_82;[From.GetBestName] calls for everyone at the Iyomante to gather around [From.GetHerHim] and then starts reciting a yukar. [From.GetSheHeCap] speaks at length about Ainu Mosir, the Land of the People, and Kamuy Mosir, the Land of the Kamuy, and the performance is certainly not the worst I have heard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_82;Tolerable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_83;I call for my guests to come closer so that they can hear me and begin reciting the yukar. I start speaking about Ainu Mosir, the Land of the People, and Kamuy Mosir, and it quickly becomes clear that the guests do not think I am doing a remotely good job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_83;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_84;[From.GetBestName] calls for everyone at the Iyomante to gather around [From.GetHerHim] and then starts reciting a yukar. The performance is one of the worst I have ever heard, and judging by the expression on the faces of others nearby I am not alone in thinking that it is a poor performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_84;That wasn't very good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_85;As the festivities at the Iyomante continue I have the opportunity to recite a yukar. Doing it well would impress the others present, but if should fail to recite it properly it would be rather embarassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_96;The Iyomante has come to an end, with a kamuy returned to Kamuy Mosir. I need to get back to ruling my realm, and my vassals need to return home to manage their own lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_96;That was rather fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_97;[From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante has come to an end, with a kamuy returned to Kamuy Mosir. It is time for me to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_97;Until next time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_98;The Iyomante has come to an end, even though we did not return a kamuy to Kamuy Mosir. I need to get back to ruling my realm, and my vassals need to return home to manage their own lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_99;[From.GetBestName]'s Iyomante has come to an end, wwithout a bear being properly sent off. It is time for me to return home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_99;Maybe the next one will be better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_100;A war has broken out, and I cannot afford to celebrate an Iyomante at this time and need to cancel it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_IYOMANTE_100;I'm sure my vassals will understand...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_IYOMANTE_101;[Root.GetBestName]\nI regret to inform you that the Iyomante has been cancelled due to the ongoing war.\n\nBest regards,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
