BM_INTERESTING_TIMES_INFO;The Middle Kingdom is in turmoil, and has been that way ever since Taizu of Liang overthrew the Tang dynasty nearly three decades ago. Six would-be Emperors of China -- Li Congke of Tang, Liao (Yelu) Deguang of Liao, Shi Jingtang of Jin, Meng Chang of Shu, Yang Pu of Wu, and Liu Yan of Han -- all claim to possess the Mandate of Heaven, but whether one of them, one of their descendants, or someone else will prevail over the others has yet to be determined. Perhaps none of them will prevail and someone else will manage to secure the Dragon Throne, or perhaps the Middle Kingdom will never recover, which no doubt would please at least some of those who have lived in the shadow of the Dragon in the past. Regardless of what the future holds, these are certainly interesting times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_WOUNDED_DRAGON;The Wounded Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_WOUNDED_DRAGON_INFO;The An-Shi Rebellion has been crushed, but the Middle Kingdom has yet to fully recover. Many areas still refuse to acknowledge the authority of the Dragon Throne, and with several of them having forged alliances bringing them to heel is unlikely to be an easy task. In the west, several protectorates are still cut off from the heart of the Middle Kingdom, with many formerly Chinese areas under Tibetan control, and the Tibetans also maintain their grip over Nanzhao in the south, no doubt eager to oppose any Tang ambitions in the region. Though some of the speculation that the Tang dynasty no longer possesses the Mandate of Heaven has died down, putting and end to the lingering doubts is not going to be an easy task.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_EMPRESS_IN_THE_EAST;The Three Kings and the Empress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_EMPRESS_IN_THE_EAST_INFO;East of the Middle Kingdom, Silla is ruled by the eleven-year old Hyegong, perhaps a sign that trouble is to come. To Silla's north, Yeojeong of Goguryeo desperately clings on to the few scraps of land that remain to him, and Mun of Balhae tries to keep his culturally and religiously diverse realm together. In Japan, Empress Shotoku sits on the Chrysanthemum Throne for the second time, with the monk Dokyo tending to her health and perhaps also spending time in her bedchamber, while the northern frontier of her realm supposedly is secure under the control of Korehazi Azamaro, an Emishi warlord that may or may not have ambitions incompatible with those of the Chrysanthemum Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_OF_THE_REGENT;Rise of the Regent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_OF_THE_REGENT_INFO;Though Emperor Seiwa recently came of age, his maternal grandfather, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, still serves as his Regent, an unpredecented turn of events that may or may not cause trouble for the other clans in Japan, such as the Minamoto clan. On the mainland, Li Wen rules Tang in a manner that many might consider irresponsible, and the dynasty has yet to recover fully from the An-Shi Rebellion despite over a century having passed since that ended, and though the fall of the Tibetan Empire means the western border is more secure the Dragon Throne's power is not what it once was, and there are those that whisper that perhaps the Mandate of Heaven no longer belongs to the Tang dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DYNASTIES_OF_THE_SOUTH;Dynasties of the South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DYNASTIES_OF_THE_SOUTH_INFO;The influence of the Sailedra dynasty, successor of the Srivijaya dynasty, extends quite far, though not as far as it once did. In Java, Maharaja Lokapala, the nephew of Maharajahiraja Balaputradeva, continues to defy Palembang, like his mother before him, and in Bali, Kesari Warmadewa, supposedly a bastard prince, has ambitions of his own. In northern Sumatra, the faith of the Prophet is spreading, while the Khmer Empire is growing stronger in the north, currently under the rule of Chakravartin Jayavarman III, the son of its founder. To his north and west, Champa, once a bastion of the Hindu faith, is now under the rule of the Buddhist Indravarman II, the founder of the Bhrigu dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GREAT_AMBITIONS;Great Ambitions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GREAT_AMBITIONS_INFO;As the Middle Kingdom is waging war on itself, Taejo of Goryeo wages war on Hubaekje, seeking to unite the Korean Peninsula once more, and perhaps expand beyond it now that the Dragon Throne cannot interfere. Across the Tsushima Strait, the child-emperor Suzaku sits on the Chrysanthemum Throne and Fujiwara no Tadahira, the Regent, exercises great power at his behest, all in the name of the good of the realm, though Fujiwara no Sumitomo and Taira no Masakado are amassing personal power at an alarming rate. And, far to the north, Hanpu, chieftain of the Wanyan clan, is moving to unite the Jurchen tribes, perhaps making the first moves towards the founding of a dynasty that one day will make a claim on the Mandate of Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_UNSTABLE_SOUTH;The Unstable South;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_UNSTABLE_SOUTH_INFO;Having recently thrown back the forces of Han, Duong Dinh-Nghe of Annam has ambitions to secure and perhaps expand his rule, but Kieu Cong-Tien might have plans of his own that do not bode well for his liege. Further west, Yang Ganzhen rules Da Yining as the first ruler of the third dynasty to rule what once was Nanzhao in the span of just a few decades. Having failed to imprison his vassal Duan Siping, his rule might not last much longer. South of Annam, the Khmer Empire has expanded west and south, but with new lands come new problems, and to their south the Sailedra dynasty's hold might endure for now, but religious tensions or other problems might yet prove its undoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EMPIRES_IN_THE_NORTH;The Empires in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EMPIRES_IN_THE_NORTH_INFO;Minamoto no Yoshiie, now known as "Hachimantaro" (the son of Hachiman), has triumphed over the Abe clan and the northernmost part of Honshu is once more at peace and firmly controlled by the Kiyohara clan, which no doubt pleases the Chrysanthemum Throne and Fujiwara no Yorimichi, sometimes called "Ichi no Hito" (the First Subject), who wields more power than any Regent before him save perhaps his father. On the mainland, the Song dynasty has lasted for over a hundred years and controls most of the Middle Kingdom, the Sixteen Prefectures are still subject to the Liao dynasty, which still claims the Dragon Throne, and in the west the Tangut realm of Xia has made such a claim as well, though at this point they have yet to prove themselves a credible threat to the Dragon Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_AND_FALL_OF_EMPIRES;Rise and Fall of Empires;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_RISE_AND_FALL_OF_EMPIRES_INFO;The once-great realm ruled by the Sailendra dynasty has not yet recovered from the Chola attack and the sack of Palembang four decades back, and many of its former subjects refuse to accept its authority, confident that their former overlord will be unable to punish their defiance. Further north, the Khmer Empire endures, though its western lands no longer acknowledge the authority of Angkor, and perhaps they never will again unless a strong ruler can bring them to heel. Further west, Anawrahta of Bagan is consolidating his rule over his newly conquered subjects, but whether his dynasty will maintain their grip over the region has yet to be determined as the empire is quite new.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
