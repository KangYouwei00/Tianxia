EVTOPTC_JAPAN_5;Not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_101;Before the invites for the hanami can be sent out you will need to make some preparations, seeing as it will require various things that your servants would not normally need to know to prepare.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_101;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_102;While your guests will be staying in your court for some time during the hanami, you still need to decide whether the main event will take place during the day or the night. Which will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_102;The day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_102;The night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_103;During your preparations for the hanami, you have considered various forms of entertainment for your guests. One option would be to hire some shirabyoshi to entertain your guests. Do you wish to hire a few?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_103;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_103;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_104;Your capital could use some embellishments during the hanami. The commoners would appreciate it, for one thing, and chances are the guests would like it too. Do you want to decorate the capital?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_104;Decorate it modestly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_104;Decorate it extensively;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_104;Don't decorate it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_105;Some of the nearby Shinto shrines would doubtlessly appreciate it if you sent some offerings for the kami as part of the hanami celebrations. Do you want to do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_105;Send a small offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_105;Send a great offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_105;Send a tainted offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_105;Send nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_106;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] is sending some offerings to a Shinto shrine in preparation for an upcoming hanami. You believe you have the opportunity to taint those offerings, should you wish to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_106;Taint the offerings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_106;Too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_107;Your personal garden has seen better days, and with the guests having to spend time there to enjoy the cherry blossoms properly it might be a good idea to improve the garden. Do you wish to do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_107;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_107;I will hire a gardener!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_107;I know how to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_107;It isn't worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_108;You will need to have food prepared for the hanami. The question is, how much are you willing to spend on the food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_109;With the preparations out of the way, it is time to invite your vassals to join you for the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_110;[Root.GetTitledName], I hereby invite you to my upcoming hanami.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_110;I will attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_110;I won't attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_111;[Root.GetTitledName], I have no interest in joining you for your hanami, and refuse to attend.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_112;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_112;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. As your vassals arrive from both near and far, you look out across your garden with a smile on your face.\n\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion, and everyone will come away from it satisfied. If not, it is too late to do anything about it now. You wave over a nearby servant and give them a few quick instructions before you head down to greet one of the new arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_112;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. As your vassals arrive from both near and far, you look out across your garden with a smile on your face.\n\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion, and everyone will come away from it satisfied, but there are a thousand things that could go wrong. Of course, it is a bit late to worry about that now, and you do your best to put it out of your mind as you head down to greet one of the recent arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_112;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_113;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_113;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as your party arrives, and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and you see both familiar faces and faces you barely recognize.\n\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and you hope that you will have a good time, along with everyone else. Doubtlessly, [From.GetTitledName] has prepared for every eventuality, as [From.GetSheHe] has a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face as [From.GetSheHe] greets you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_113;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as your party arrives, and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and you see both familiar faces and faces you barely recognize.\n\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and you hope that everyone will have a good time. Given that [From.GetTitledName] seems unconcerned as [From.GetSheHe] greets you, there should be nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_113;Thank you for inviting me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_116;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to extensively decorate [From.GetHerHis] capital for the hanami, and it truly is a sight to behold. Even if you ignore the cherry trees themselves, it is a most impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_116;Indeed it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_117;Your servants inform you that they have overheard [From.GetTitledName] speak with approval of the decorations you saw fit to hang up in your capital. Clearly, not only the commoners appreciate the display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_117;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_118;Aside from the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden and elsewhere, [From.Capital.GetName] is almost entirely without decorations. It seems [From.GetTitledName] cannot be bothered to show off [From.GetHerHis] wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_118;This is far too plain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_119;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] dislike of the lack of decorations in [Root.Capital.GetName] where people could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps you should have invested more in decorations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_119;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_120;Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has seen fit to send some offerings to a nearby Shinto shrine as part of the hanami celebration, doubtlessly hoping that the kami will be pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_120;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_120;I should say that I approve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_121;Shortly after thanks arrived from the shrine you sent offerings to, [From.GetTitledName] took the time to add [From.GetHerHis] own thanks to those of the priests at the shrine. It would seem that [From.GetSheHe] was impressed by your generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_121;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_122;It would seem that [From.GetTitledName] has not seen fit to send a proper offering to the kami at a nearby shrine. The priests did not see fit to complain, but you could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_122;I am offended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_122;Pretend to be outraged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_123;[From.GetTitledName] requested a word in private with you, and once you were away from the other guests [From.GetSheHe] angrily complained about the lack of a proper offering for the kami of a nearby shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_123;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_125;Your attempt to taint the offerings sent to a shrine as part of the hanami has been successful. The priests sent a messenger thanking you profusedly for the offerings, which now pollute the shrine with unholy energies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_125;Perhaps I should send more "gifts"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_126;A priest arrived today from the shrine you sent offerings to, informing you that the offerings seemed unclean and that the priests had decided not to present them to the kami. However, you do not seem to be under suspicion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_126;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_127;It would seem the priests at the shrine you sent some tainted offerings to are a suspicious lot. The sabotage was discovered, and now fingers are being pointed your way. Nothing can be proven, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_127;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_129;Your tainting of the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine went well. The priests have sent word that they are thankful for the offerings, and clearly they are not suspecting that their shine has been befouled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_129;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_130;Your attempt to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine did not pan out. The priests discovered that something was awry with the offerings right away, even if your involvement does not seem to be suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_130;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_131;Word has reached you from the shrine you sent some offerings to that someone has attempted to pollute them. The priests are convinced that you are not to blame, but they cannot determine whose fault it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_131;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_132;You attempted to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine, but this has turned out poorly. There is no proof, but you have heard whispers suggesting your involvement, and perhaps someone will believe them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_132;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_133;The hanami at [From.GetTitledName]'s capital is mainly taking place beneath the cherry trees in the garden. You have seen well-tended gardens in the past, but the garden of [From.GetTitledName] is one of the best you have encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_133;I really like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_134;[From.GetTitledName] appears to be awestruck at the state of your garden, and has been heard praising the work that has been done there in preparation for the hanami. Evidently, you made the right decision to improve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_134;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_135;While the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden are in full bloom, the effect is somewhat diminished by the poor state of the garden as a whole. It seems [From.GetTitledName] does not care about tending it at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_135;How unsightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_136;You did not put a lot of effort into improving your garden before the start of the hanami, and [From.GetTitledName] appears to be horrified at the state of it as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard loudly complaining about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_136;Not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_137;While [From.GetTitledName] has prepared some diversions during the hanami, [From.GetSheHe] does not appear to have seen fit to hire any entertainers despite it being a perfect occasion to bring out some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_137;This is boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_138;[From.GetTitledName] has been complaining loudly about the lack of shirabyoshi where all of the guests could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps you should have paid for some entertainment to avoid upsetting [From.GetHerHim] and everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_138;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_139;The shirabyoshi you hired to entertain your guests did not show up on time, and as more and more time passes you slowly realize that they probably are not coming. Given that they have not seen fit to send an explanation, they have probably made a run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_139;Thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_140;[From.GetTitledName] has been claiming that there would be shirabyoshi entertaining the guests at some point during the hanami, but they never make an appearance, and [From.GetTitledName] offers no explanation for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_140;Were any actually hired?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_141;The shirabyoshi you hired show up on time and start to entertain the guests with their music and dancing. However, you quickly realize that they are not particularly skilled in their chosen field, and the entertainment is not particularly enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_141;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_142;[From.GetTitledName] has hired some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone at the hanami, but they are not particularly good as their songs are off-key and their dancing is uncoordinated at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_142;Make them stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_143;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has hired some shirabyoshi to perform at [From.GetHerHis] hanami, and you find their entertainment inspiring. You get the opportunity to approach them to ask for advice on a certain skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_143;Teach me how to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_143;Tell me about business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_143;Tell me about poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_143;Teach me to convince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_144;It seems your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] has been inspired by the shirabyoshi you hired and has learned from them after talking with them for a while. Hopefully, this will be an advantage in the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_144;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_145;As you take a walk amongst the cherry trees on your own, you come across [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. You have always been curious about whether the shirabyoshi know how to use the sword they wear, and when you inquire about it [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] suggests a duel to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_145;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_145;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_146;[From.GetTitledName] has approached you and let you know that [From.GetSheHe] and [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] are planning to duel one another as [From.GetTitledName] wants to know if the shirabyoshi can fight or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_146;I'll allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_146;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_147;Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has refused your request to duel [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], claiming that that is not the kind of entertainment [From.GetSheHe] hired the shirabyoshi to perform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_147;I could have taken her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_149;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] were apparently planning to fight a duel to find out if the latter only carries a sword for show or if she actually knows how to use it, but it would seem [From.GetTitledName] has forbidden it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_149;It could have been fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_150;Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has approved your request to duel [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. As the final preparations are being made, you need to determine how you will approach the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_150;Hold back a bit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_150;Fight fairly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_150;Try a few tricks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_150;Fight to kill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_151;[From.GetTitledName] will soon be fighting you in a duel to find out if you can fight or if your sword is just for show. How do you want to approach the duel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_152;It seems [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi] will soon be fighting a duel, supposedly because [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is curious about whether shirabyoshi know how to fight. Perhaps it will be for show, or perhaps the two combatants will try to kill one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_152;This should be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_154;The duel between you and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] isn not over in an instant, but you gain the upper hand relatively quickly and keep the pressure up until you can manage to disarm the shirabyoshi.\n\n"The fight is yours, my [Root.GetLordLady]," she says, bowing her head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_154;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_154;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_154;DIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_155;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] still seemed convinced that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a competent fighter, complimenting her for putting up a good fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_155;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, instead of being a good winner, [From.GetTitledName] decided to mock the shirabyoshi for thinking that she had a chance in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_155;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_156;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. It seems as if the shirabyoshi impressed [FromFrom.GetTitledName], though, since [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saw fit to compliment her skills after the duel was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_156;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. Upon disarming the shirabyoshi, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] saw fit to be a poor winner and mocked the shirabyoshi for challenging [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_156;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_157;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, apparently simply disarming the shirabyoshi was not good enough for [From.GetTitledName], as [From.GetSheHe] decided to strike down the unarmed woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_157;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_158;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], even if it was not a quick victory. The shirabyoshi surrendered upon losing her sword, but [FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not see fit to let her live and struck her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_158;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_159;Your duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] goes on for quite some time with neither of you getting the upper hand, and eventually [FromFromFromFrom.GetTitledName] declares it a draw. Are you prepared to admit that the shirabyoshi was quite good, or will you claim you held back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_159;You're good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_159;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_160;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. Surprisingly, [From.GetTitledName] saluted the shirabyoshi and praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_160;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_161;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. Surprisingly enough, this outcome appears to have been acceptable for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saluted the shirabyoshi at the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_161;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_162;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. [From.GetTitledName] loudly claimed that [From.GetSheHe] held back as [From.GetSheHe] sheathed [From.GetHerHis] sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_162;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_163;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. As [FromFrom.GetSheHe] sheathed [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sword, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] loudly claimed that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was holding back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_163;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_164;Your duel against [From.GetTitledName] is not completely one-sided, but you gain the upper hand eventually and manage to disarm [From.GetHerHim]. You could demand [From.GetHerHis] surrender at this point, or just strike [From.GetHerHim] down where [From.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_164;Well fought, my [From.GetLordLady]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_164;DIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_166;Your duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] does not go well. It is not entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm you, and you are forced to yield. You might be able to claim that you did not fight at your full potential, should you wish to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_166;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_166;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_167;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] wasn not particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] did not seem to have an hard feelings towards [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and instead praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_167;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_168;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. However, instead of trying to save face, [From.GetTitledName] decided to praise the shirabyoshi's skills after the fight was over, which seemed to please her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_168;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_169;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was not particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. As the shirabyoshi walked away, [From.GetTitledName] loudly proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_169;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_170;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. As the shirabyoshi sheathed her sword and started to walk away, [From.GetTitledName] started to claim that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_170;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_171;Your duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] does not go well. It is not entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm you. Before you have the chance to yield, she raises her sword again and cuts you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_171;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_172;[FromFrom.GetBestName] managed to prevail against [From.GetTitledName] in their duel, and the shirabyoshi is not content with simply beating her opponent. Before [From.GetTitledName] manages to surrender, [From.GetSheHe] is cut down by [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_172;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_172;Imprison that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_173;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and the shirabyoshi is completely merciless on victory, striking [FromFrom.GetTitledName] down where [FromFrom.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_173;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_174;Amongst the shirabyoshi you hired, [remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] truly stands out as exceptional, and she offers to stay at your court after the hanami is over. This is too good an opportunity to turn down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_174;Stay as long as you like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_175;One of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired, [From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], has proven to be a far better performer than the average shirabyoshi, and you are not surprised when you learn that she will become a permanent member of [From.GetTitledName]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_175;Good for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_176;There is always a risk that the weather will be bad during the day of the hanami, which can ruin the experience, but the weather could not have been better this time, and everyone can fully enjoy the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_176;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_177;You have had some fun spending time with [From.hanami_friend_2.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami. Perhaps you should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_177;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_177;Let's not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_178;[From.GetBestName] appears to like your company at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and you also enjoy their company. It comes as no surprise when [From.GetBestName] suggests the two of you should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_178;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_178;Let's not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_179;[From.GetBestName] seems to have enjoyed your company too, as [From.GetSheHe] is happy to declare you [From.GetHerHis] friend. Surely, this is the start of many great things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_179;It would seem [From.GetBestName] has not enjoyed your company as much as you have enjoyed spending thime with [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] claims to have no interest to become your friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_179;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_179;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_180;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami [From.hanami_rival_2.GetBestName] has been extremely poor company, and you cannot help but to feel insulted by the way they speak to you. Do you intend to demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_180;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_180;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_181;[From.GetBestName] appears to have taken some things you have said during [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s personally, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that you apologize for the things you have said. Is this something you want to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_181;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_181;Of course I'll apologize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_182;[From.GetBestName] refused to apologize to you, and doubled down on [From.GetHerHis] insults towards you. It is clear that this is the start of a rivalry between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_182;[From.GetBestName] apparently did not mean the things [From.GetSheHe] said and has apologized over the insults, seemingly sincerely sorry to have offended you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_182;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_182;Apology accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_183;During the hanami, you come across [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] loudly arguing with one another. You cannot tell what the reason for their quarrel is, but perhaps you could try to smooth things over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_183;Try to calm them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_183;Quietly walk away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_184;It seems your attempt to smooth things over has been successful, for [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] quickly calm down and are conversing as friends again by the time you are walking away from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_184;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_185;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, you and another vassal ended up arguing with one another. Luckily, [From.GetTitledName] managed to clear up the misunderstanding and you now know that there was no reason to get angry with anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_185;Thanks for the help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_186;Your attempt to meddle in the argument between [arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] did not go well, and they are now angry with both you and one another. Perhaps it would have been better if you had not meddled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_186;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_187;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, you and another vassal ended up arguing with one another. [From.GetTitledName] apparently thought that [From.GetSheHe] could be a diplomat and clear things up, but [From.GetSheHe] only made things worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_187;You are still wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_188;A priestess from a nearby shrine made an unexpected appearance at your hanami, offering to say a few words and to make a small offering to the kami in your name after you welcomed her to the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_188;Sure, why not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_189;As [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami continues, you find yourself talking to [From.hanami_lover_2.GetBestName], a very lovely [From.hanami_lover_2.GetManWoman]. You cannot tell for sure, but they might be interested in you in a romantic way, and it would be easy to slip away into the night with them if they agree to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_189;Try to seduce them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_189;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_190;You have been talking to [From.GetBestName] for quite some time at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami and think that they are a fine [From.GetManWoman]. It does not surprise you particularly much when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of you should find someplace private to get to know one another more closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_190;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_190;No, I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_191;[From.GetBestName] did not seem to appreciate your attempt to get to know them intimately, and [From.GetSheHe] hastily ended your conversation and hurried away. Hopefully, they will not speak of your suggestion with anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_191;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_192;[From.GetBestName] was amenable to your suggestion to slip away into the darkness to get to know one another intimately, and it is not long before you find a secluded part of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden and start to get undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_192;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_193;You have taken a short break from the festivities and are taking a walk through a secluded part of your garden when you hear a sound from behind some bushes. You go around them and find [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] entwined with one another, neither of them wearing any clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_193;Keep it secret;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_193;Attempt to blackmail them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_193;Tell everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_194;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon you and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_194;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_195;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon you and [FromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_195;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_196;[From.GetTitledName] discovered you and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of you can speak, [From.GetTitledName] asks you what [From.GetHerHis] silence is worth to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_196;I'll pay you some gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_196;I'll owe you a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_196;I won't be blackmailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JAPAN_196;You will pay 25 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_JAPAN_196;You will owe a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_198;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] discovered you and [From.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of you can speak, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] asks you what [FromFrom.GetHerHis] silence is worth to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_199;Both [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] agreed to pay you off to keep their tryst secret without any complaints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_199;I will keep it secret, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JAPAN_199;[This.GetBestName] pays you 25 gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_JAPAN_199;[This.GetBestName] owes you a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_200;You could not get [hanami_lover_1.GetBestName] and [hanami_lover_2.GetBestName] to agree to any concessions in exchange for your silence, and this leaves you no option but to expose their tryst to everyone at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_200;You asked for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_201;[From.GetTitledName] has outed your tryst to everyone at the hanami, and since there is no possible way for you to attempt to cover up the situation the scandal is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_201;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_202;[From.GetTitledName] somehow caught wind of the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] were sleeping together, and has outed their relationship to everyone at the hanami. Given that the two were discovered together in a state of undress, there is no plausible alternative explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_202;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_202;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_202;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_203;It seems the sounds from your hanami carries well beyond your garden, for some of the townspeople have sent a message asking you to try to quiet things down a bit so that they can sleep properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_203;We'll tone it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_203;Shut up, peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_204;In the middle of the night, you can see something moving about in the darkness just at the edge of your vision. You cannot tell who or what it is, and it might just be your mind playing tricks on you, but that is not certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_204;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_204;Guards! GUARDS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_205;As the hanami continues, you find [sleeping_hanami_vassal.GetBestName] asleep in a somewhat secluded part of your garden. The temptation to draw something on [sleeping_hanami_vassal.GetHerHis] face is almost impossible to overcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_205;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_205;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_207;You accidentally fell asleep during the hanami in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden since you slept poorly the night before. When you wake up, you hear the sound of laughter, and it does not take you long to discover that someone has drawn something inappropriate on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_207;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_208;You accidentally fell asleep during the hanami in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden since you slept poorly the night before. Before long, you wake up to discover that [From.GetTitledName] is trying to draw something on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_208;What are you doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_209;[From.GetBestName] wakes up as you are drawing on their face and angrily demand that you stop. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] was not as soundly asleep as you had thought that [From.GetSheHe] was, or that you are considerably less stealthy than you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_209;It was just a prank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_210;You have made sure that there is plenty of sake for the guests at your hanami, and know for sure that there is enough to go around even if you have some. Surely there is no harm in drinking some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_210;Drink in moderation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_210;Drink a lot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_210;Drink more than you should;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_211;The cherry blossoms at the hanami are certainly inspiring, and you find yourself in the mood for writing some poetry. Perhaps you should challenge [From.GetTitledName] to a poetry contest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_211;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_211;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_212;[From.GetTitledName] appears to feel inspired by the cherry blossoms and has suggested that the two of you compete with one another in a poetry contest. Do you agree to the proposal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_213;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has no interest in poetry, for [From.GetSheHe] turned down your suggested poetry contest right away and suggested that [From.GetSheHe] had better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_213;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_215;After you and your opponent have written your poems, you hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation, they decide that you have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_215;I am a poet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_215;That was nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_215;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_216;After you and your opponent have written your poems, you hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation, they decide that you have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_216;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_217;[From.hanami_duel_vassal_2.GetBestName] has insulted you during the hanami, and it would be well within your rights to challenge them to a duel. Do you wish to do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_217;Challenge them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_217;Let's not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_218;Apparently, [From.GetBestName] feels that you have insulted [From.GetHerHim] at the hanami, and [From.GetSheHe] is now challenging you to a duel. However, if you apologize, the duel could be avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_218;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_218;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_219;It appears [From.GetBestName] does not wish to fight you, as [From.GetSheHe] instead has apologized for upsetting you. Perhaps it is for the best to let the matter rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_219;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_220;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_220;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, neither came out ahead in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_220;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_220;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_221;You and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and you quickly get the upper hand. Before long, they are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_221;You and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of you can get the upper hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_221;You and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they quickly get the upper hand. Before long, you are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_JAPAN_221;You and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they quickly get the upper hand. Before long, you are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_JAPAN_221;You and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of you can get the upper hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_JAPAN_221;You and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and you quickly get the upper hand. Before long, they are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_221;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_221;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_221;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_221;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_221;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_JAPAN_221;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_222;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_222;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, neither came out ahead in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_222;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_222;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_223;[From.GetTitledName] has has several truly magnificient meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_223;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_223;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_223;Stay silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_224;[From.GetTitledName] has has several decent meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_225;[From.GetTitledName] has has several very plain meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_226;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] likes the quality of the food you had prepared for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly praise you for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_226;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_227;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] does not like the quality of the food you had prepared for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly complain about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_227;Shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_228;As the hanami continues, you come across [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] several more times and find her company enjoyable. Perhaps you two should try to get closer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_228;We should be lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_228;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_228;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_229;It seems [From.GetBestName] fancies you as [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that you retire to [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber to get to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_229;I like how [From.GetSheHe] thinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_229;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_230;[From.GetBestName] proved to be amenable to your suggestion, and soon the two of you have managed to find your way to your bedchamber. It does not take long before the two of you are fully undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_230;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_231;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming your lover, as she turned down your proposition and quickly hurried away. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it will not happen during the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_231;I see..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_232;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken an interest in getting to know you better after your duel, and now it seems [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be your friend. The question is, do you think [From.GetSheHe] would make a good friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_232;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_232;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_233;[From.GetBestName] is elated when you propose that the two of you should begin a long-term friendship. Regardless of how your duel went, it seems you can put your differences aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_233;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_234;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming friends with you. Perhaps the events surrounding your duel with her are to blame, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_234;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_235;[shirabyoshi_foe.GetBestName] did not treat you courteously at the end of your duel with [shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim]. As the hanami continues, you believe that you see an opportunity to kill [shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim]. Do you want to try?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_235;Yes, [shirabyoshi_foe.GetSheHe] must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_235;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_236;As you are walking by yourself in a secluded part of [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden, [From.GetBestName] appears out of nowhere with her sword in her hand. With a loud war cry, she moves to attack you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_236;Try to fight her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_236;Try to flee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_237;Somehow you manage to slip away from [FromFrom.GetBestName] in the gardem without being wounded. You suspect that she still is looking for you, and waste no time before ordering her arrest when you encounter some of the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_237;Find that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_238;It seems [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has been attacked by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought a duel against previously. The attack was unsuccessful, but so was the attempt to apprehend the shirabyoshi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_238;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_239;You make your best attempt to slip away from [FromFrom.GetBestName], but in your haste you trip over a rock and fall to the ground. Before you can get back to your feet or draw your sword, the shirabyoshi is upon you, and she shows you no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_239;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_240;Some of your guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. It would seen that an unknown assailant attacked [From.GetHerHim] and killed [From.GetHerHim], presumably with a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_240;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_240;I have some suspicions, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_240;The shirabyoshi did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_241;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as you learned before, but she is no match for you, and you manage to find an opening and quickly strike her down without her inflicting so much as a scratch on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_241;Now we know the better fighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_242;[From.GetBestName] returns to the other guests after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in your garden, and quickly informs you that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense, taking no wounds in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_242;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_243;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as you learned before, and she inflicts several wounds on you before you manage to strike her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_243;That will probably scar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_244;[From.GetBestName] returns to the other guests after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in your garden, and quickly informs you that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense. Judging by [From.GetHerHis] wounds, she did not go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_244;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_245;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, as you learned before, and though you manage to strike her down in the end she has severely wounded you in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_245;At least I survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_246;[From.GetBestName] returns to the other guests after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in your garden, severely injured, but with a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face. Apparently, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] attacked [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] narrowly managed to beat her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_246;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_247;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, and she manages to find an opening in your defences quickly enough, drawing blood. One wound becomes two, then three, and eventually you lack the strength to keep her from striking you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_247;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_248;Some of your guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. As the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought earlier is nowhere to be found, it seems that she killed [From.GetHerHim] and then fled before the body was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_248;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_249;The shirabyoshi you fought before, [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], was a competent fighter, which resulted in humiliation for you. Still, you believe you know her weaknesses and see an opportunity to attack her, if you so wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_249;Attack her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_249;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_250;You surprise [FromFrom.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not enough so that she is unable to put up some resistance. However, the fight quickly turns in your favor, and you manage to kill her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_250;I win this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_251;You surprise [FromFrom.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not enough so that she is unable to put up some resistance, and she manages to inflict several minor wounds before the fight turns in your favor and you can cut her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_251;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_252;You surprise [FromFrom.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not enough so that she is unable to put up some resistance. She manages to get in several good strikes, and you do not walk away from the fight in one piece despite eventually cutting her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_252;At least I still live...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_253;It seems [From.GetBestName] has attacked [troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] in your garden. It is doubtful that it was in self-defense, but you cannot punish [From.GetBestName] without knowing for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_253;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_254;[FromFrom.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as you move to attack her, and she meets you with her sword drawn. Before long, the fight turns against you, and eventually she strikes you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_254;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_255;[FromFrom.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as you move to attack her, and she meets you with her sword drawn. Though you manage to wound her, the fight turns against you, and eventually she strikes you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_255;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_256;[FromFrom.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as you move to attack her, and she meets you with her sword drawn. You make sure that she will not walk away in one piece, but the fight turns against you, and eventually she strikes you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_256;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_257;[troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] demands to speak to you, and you agree to her request. She tells you that [From.GetBestName] attacked her in your garden and that she was forced to kill [From.GetHerHim] in self-defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_257;You did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_257;Leave my court, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_257;Guards, seize her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_258;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free and at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_258;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_259;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free, though not at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_259;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_260;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, but [From.GetTitledName] still has seen fit to imprison her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_260;Serves her right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_261;[From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]'s skill with a sword was most impressive, and you have decided to learn from her. She teaches you quite a few tricks in a surprisingly short amount of time, and you find that you have more in common than an interest in swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_261;I have a new best friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_262;It seems [From.troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] have become friends and that the shirabyoshi is teaching your [GetFromRelation] how to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_262;That's... good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_263;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is a most impressive woman, and you find that you are enjoying spending time with her. Perhaps this is the start of a lasting friendship, or it could perhaps be more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_263;Try to seduce her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_263;Try to befriend her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_263;No, this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_264;[From.GetTitledName] seems to have been enjoying your performance throughout the hanami, and it does not come as a big surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps you should come with [From.GetHerHim] somewhere more private for a different form of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_264;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_264;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_265;[From.GetBestName] agreed to your suggestion that the two of you should retire to somewhere private, and it does not take very long before both of you are undressed and getting to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_265;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_266;Your suggestion that you and [From.GetBestName] should retire to somewhere private was not appreciated by the shirabyoshi, and she hastily excused herself and headed elsewhere. While still in your court, it seems like she will not be in your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_266;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_267;It seems [From.GetTitledName] truly is enjoying your company, and that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to remain on good terms with you. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that you perhaps should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_267;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_267;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_268;[From.GetBestName] seems very open to the idea of being friends with you. Doubtlessly this will only bring good things down the line as she truly is a remarkable woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_268;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_269;Despite your generous suggestion, [From.GetBestName] does not seem open to the idea of becoming friends with you. Perhaps it will change over time, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_269;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_270;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not cease to impress as the hanami continues. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. You could not have found a better shirabyoshi easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_270;She truly is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_271;[From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], one of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami, truly is something special. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. You are not sure you have ever seen better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_271;She truly is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_272;[remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] truly is a remarkable woman, and she seems to have a much better grasp of military matters than you would have expected from a shirabyoshi, greater than many of your potential commanders. Perhaps you should make her one of you commanders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_272;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_272;No, this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_273;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to appoint [From.remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] as a commander, which is a highly irregular decision since she is a woman and [From.GetTitledName] usually does not allow them to command troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_273;That is just wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_273;Why can she command and not I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_274;The shirabyoshi you hired for the hanami have performed quite well throughout the event. While none of them are truly exceptional, there is no doubt that they still are well-trained entertainers fit to entertain the likes of you and your guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_274;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_275;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are quite good. They are not the kind of great shirabyoshi you are unlikely to see more than a few times in a lifetime, but they are certainly not bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_275;Keep on performing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_276;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are getting on your nerves. While they are unfailingly polite towards everyone else, the behaviour they show towards you is anything but polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_276;I want them gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_277;[From.GetTitledName] has told you that [From.GetSheHe] feels that the shirabyoshi you hired are being extremely impolite towards [From.GetHerHim], and has asked you to expel them from the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_277;Throw them out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_277;They can stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_278;[From.GetTitledName] agreed to throw out the shirabyoshi as you requested. There will be less entertainment now, but at least the impolite shirabyoshi are not going to ruin the hanami for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_278;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_279;[From.GetTitledName] did not believe you when you claimed that the shirabyoshi were being rude towards you, and [From.GetSheHe] has decided to allow them to stay at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_279;Why take their side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_280;You have been spending some time with [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] seems to have a lot in common with you. Perhaps you should attempt to become [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetHerHis] friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_280;Yes, let's do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_280;I have enough friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_281;[From.GetBestName] and you have spent some time together at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and you have enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] company. It seems the feeling is mutual, and [From.GetBestName] has suggested that you sould be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_281;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_281;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_282;[From.GetBestName] seemed thrilled at the prospect of becoming your friend, and [From.GetSheHe] said that your company truly had been enjoyable at the hanami. Hopefully, you will have more fun together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_282;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not enjoy your company as much as you enjoy [From.GetHerHis], for [From.GetSheHe] found your suggestion of becoming friends silly and told you that it was not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_282;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_282;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_284;[From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] has been getting on your nerves during [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and you find that nearly everything [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] is a thinly veiled insult at best. Do you want to demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_284;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_284;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_285;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been taking your jokes at [From.GetHerHis] expense very seriously, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that you say that you are sorry. If not, chances are [From.GetBestName] will hold a grudge towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_285;I'm not sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_285;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_286;[From.GetBestName] laughed in your face when you demanded an apology for [From.GetHerHis] insults. If [From.GetSheHe] is not going to attempt to be on friendly terms, you will have to make sure that [From.GetSheHe] goes down in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_286;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not mean to insult you with the things [From.GetSheHe] said, and [From.GetSheHe] seemed most sincere when [From.GetSheHe] issued an apology. You cannot forget what was said, but it is probably best to forgive it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_286;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_286;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_288;The weather takes a turn for the worse as the hanami progresses. Dark clouds cover the sky, and you can hear thunder in the distance. You might even have to move everyone inside if the situation gets worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_288;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_289;One of your guards informs you that there is a fireworks merchant who wishes to see you. It turns out that he has heard of your hanami and that he is willing to sell you some fireworks to entertain your guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_289;I want some small ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_289;I want some mid-sized ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_289;Give me everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_289;I cannot afford any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_290;The fireworks you bought from the merchant seem simple enough to use, and you make sure that your guests all will have a good view of the sky. The explosions are not particularly impressive, but it seems like the guests still liked the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_290;Worth the money, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_291;[From.GetTitledName] has apparently gotten hold of some fireworks for the hanami. It is not exactly in line with tradition, and they are not the most impressive you have seen, but they are still somewhat entertaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_291;That was nice, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_292;The fireworks you bought from the merchant are a bit complicated, but you manage to figure out how to use them. Your guests seem impressed by the view as they light up the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_292;Money well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_293;[From.GetTitledName] has a surprise for you and the other guests in the form of some fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought. They light up the sky in a multitude of colors and are a sight to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_293;Beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_294;You think you have figured out how to use the fireworks you bought from the merchant, but you get something wrong, and one of them explodes too close to you for comfort, and you do not get away in one piece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_294;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_295;[From.GetTitledName] has bought some fireworks for the hanami, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] has not figure out how to use them safely. One of the fireworks explodes right next to [From.GetHerHim], causing a major injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_295;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_296;You are somewhat afraid of getting something wrong when you use the fireworks you bought, but luckily you get it right, and the sky is soon set ablaze. Never before have you seen anything quite as magnificient as this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_296;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_297;[From.GetTitledName] has you and the other guests gather where you can get a good view of the sky as [From.GetSheHe] starts setting off a large number of fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought for the hanami. Before long, the sky is ablaze in a truly magnificient fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_297;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_298;The fireworks you bought are more complicated than you initially thought, but you believe you have figured out how to use them safely by the time that your guests await the display. Unfortunately, something goes wrong and you are badly injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_298;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_299;[From.GetTitledName] brings out a large amount of fireworks and proudly proclaims that you are about to witness something grand. Unfortunately for [From.GetHerHim], the fireworks are less safe than expected, and [From.GetTitledName] is maimed in thr process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_299;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_300;You manage to figure out how to set off the fireworks you bought without harming yourself, but one of them flies off into the crowd and blows up right in the face of [fireworks_victim.GetBestName], killing [fireworks_victim.GetHerHim], and your remaining guests look at you in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_300;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_301;[From.GetTitledName] has bought a number of huge fireworks from someone and brings them out at the hanami. [From.GetSheHeCap] manages to set them off without problems at first, but one of them spirals out of control and flies directly at you, blowing up in your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_301;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_302;[From.GetTitledName] surprises everyone by bringing out a bunch of fireworks. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] has a magnificient spectacle in mind, but something goes wrong and one of the fireworks hits [From.fireworks_victim.GetBestName] in the face, fatally wounding [From.fireworks_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_302;What a mess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_303;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_303;Your guests quickly assemble when they hear that you have prepared a grand fireworks display. Everything goes well at first, and the sky is soon lit by colorful explosions. However, before long, things go horribly wrong.\n\nSoon, there are fireworks that fly off into the town itself, impacting several buildings and starting a number of fires that grow out of control very quickly, and other fireworks strike some of your guests, killing them where they stand.\n\nBy the time that the last fireworks have gone off, many are dead, and large parts of [Root.Capital.GetName] are ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_303;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_304;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_304;[From.GetTitledName] has proclaimed that there will be a major fireworks display during the hanami, and you and the other guests quickly gather to witness it.\n\nIt starts well enough, but soon there are fireworks flying off into the crowd and the nearby town, starting fires in several places and killing many people before they can escape to safety.\n\n[From.GetTitledName] is unhurt, and so are you, but it is clear that this disaster will not be something that [From.Capital.GetName] recovers from anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_304;That was a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_305;You have taken some time to look at the stars during the hanami, and you are surprised by the appearance of a comet in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_305;It's an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_JAPAN_305;Lose 1 stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_307;You and your spouse, [Root.Spouse.GetBestName], have been watching the stars together during the hanami while talking with one another, and you feel that you have gotten much closer to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] as a consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_307;I love [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_308;You and [hanami_child_friend.GetBestName] have been spending some time together watching the stars during the hanami, and you feel much closer to [hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] now. In fact, you now consider [hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] to be one of your best friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_308;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_309;The sky is clear during the night of the hanami, and the stars above are beautiful to behold. You would have loved to have someone to talk to about them, but it seems your guests are more interested in the cherry blossoms than the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_309;Ah, those are beautiful too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_310;You and several others at the hanami have decided to take part in an impromptu practice session in the hopes of improving your swordfighting skills. Hopefully, nothing will go wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_310;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_311;You do not know why, but as soon as you draw your sword you feel certain that things will go well. You do not distinguish yourself by having perfect form, but you show no fear against any of your opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_311;Not long ago, you found the idea of swordfighting dangerous, but during the practice session you find that you actually have nothing to fear. Perhaps, with a little effort, you could excel at swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_311;You do not distinguish yourself as much as some do at the practice session. In fact, you perform less well than you had expected to, and some of the others seem to be hiding smiles as you excuse yourself early to avoid further humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_JAPAN_311;The practice session does not go as well as you would have liked. You fumble with a parry and one of the others at the pracitice session accidentally gives you a cut on one of your arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_JAPAN_311;The practice session goes very well for you, and you perform very well. Several of the others suggest that you could do well as a duelist, if that is something that interests you. If not, there is still some glory to be had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_311;I fear nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_311;I don't fear swords!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_311;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_311;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_311;I'm a duelist now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_JAPAN_311;I'll just have the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_312;You have spent some time at the hanami discussing military strategy with some of your vassals. The discussion went very well, and everyone seems to agree that you have got some talent in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_312;Good news, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_312;This is the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_312;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_312;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_312;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_313;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, you sent some time talking about military strategy with the other guests. The discussion went very well, and you got some praise for your knowledge in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_313;Good news, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_313;This is the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_313;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_313;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_313;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_314;You took part in a discussion about military strategy during your hanami, but unfortunately nothing you said seemed to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_314;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_315;You spent some time at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami discussing military strategy with the other guests. Unfortunately, the things you say do not seem to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_315;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_316;You and [hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It was not over quickly, but eventually you were victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_316;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_316;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_317;[From.GetTitledName] challenged you to a game of Go during the hanami, and you obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that you had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_317;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_318;You and [hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that you had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_318;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_319;[From.GetTitledName] challenged you to a game of Go during the hanami, and you obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It was not over quickly, but eventually you were victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_319;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_319;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_322;The hanami has come to an end, and all of your guests have set off on their journey back home. You will have to wait at least one year before the next hanami can be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_322;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_323;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami is over, and it is time to depart back home. Perhaps there will be another hanami next year, or perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_323;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_324;With a war breaking out, the hanami will have to be postponed. It is doubtful that you will have time to emerge victorious quickly enough to resume the hanami this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_324;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_325;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami has unfortunately had to be cancelled due to a war breaking out, and it is doubtful that the war will be over before the cherry blossoms are gone for the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_325;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
### Kitsune
EVTDESC_JAPAN_428;You are returning home just after dusk one day when you are approached by a young woman you have never seen before. Introducing herself as [new_kitsune_or_not.GetBestName], she humbly asks whether you could arrange a place for her to stay as she is going to be in the area for a while and does not know anyone else to ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_428;I can find a place for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_428;Begone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_430;[From.GetBestName] has been staying at your court for a while now, and so far you have found her to be quite fascinating. She is also quite beautiful, and you cannot help but get the feeling that she might be interested in getting to know you quite a bit more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_430;I will suggest such a relationship!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_430;It would be inappropriate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_431;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] was not as interested in you as you had though, as she backs away from you as soon as you make your suggestion and tells you to stay away from her. Within the hour you are informed that she was seen storming out the front gate, carrying with her all of her possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_431;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_432;[FromFrom.GetBestName] turns out to be quite receptive to your suggestion, and it seems she knows the layout of your residence nearly as well as you do as she easily finds a secluded spot for the two of you to engage in lovemaking. Eventually, as you are getting dressed, she tells you that she can't wait for the next time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_432;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_433;[FromFrom.GetBestName] turns out to be quite receptive to your suggestion, and it seems she knows the layout of your residence nearly as well as you do as she easily finds a secluded spot for the two of you to engage in lovemaking. Much later, as you are getting dressed, you start to consider the future of your relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_433;This is all I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_433;I will make her a concubine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_433;I will marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_434;[From.GetBestName] and you have been getting closer and closer with each passing day. You might not have known each other very well at the start of your relationship, but you are certain both of you have come to know and care about one another at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_434;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_436;One day as you are dealing with several routine tasks one of your servants enters bearing a sealed message for you. Opening it, you discover that it is a letter by [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Reading it, you discover that it is a message that reveals that she has left your court looking for other opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_436;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_438;[From.GetBestName] has been staying at your court for quite some time now, and you have long known that she has taken an interest in the layout of your residence. One day, she approaches you with a suggestion regarding some adjustments to the guards' patrol routes that she thinks would make the place much more secure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_438;What a great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_438;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_439;A few days after the guards have adjusted their patrol routes as suggested a servant comes running and informs you that someone has broken into your treasury. A substantial amount of money turns out to be missing, and as the castle is searched for clues about the theft it is discovered that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is nowhere to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_439;She fooled us all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_440;A few days after the guards have adjusted their patrol routes as suggested a servant comes running and informs you that the guards caught a thief about to break into your treasury. It seems the new patrol routes already are paying off, and that you owe [FromFrom.GetBestName] some thanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_440;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_441;One day as you are dealing with several routine tasks one of your servants enters bearing a sealed message for you. Opening it, you discover that it is a letter by [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Reading it, you discover that it is a message that reveals that she has left your court looking for other opportunities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_441;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_443;One day you return to your quarters to find a horrifying sight inside. [From.GetBestName] is standing inside, drenched in blood and looking down at the unmoving bodies of several people close to you. Hearing you enter, she turns around and gives you a crazed smile, telling you that now nobody will keep you apart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_443;Guards! Bring me her head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_443;Guards! Toss her in the dungeon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_443;Guards! Leave me and my love!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_444;[From.GetBestName] has asked you to meet with her and several others to discuss a matter of mutual interest, and as you have no other plans you decide to humor her. [From.GetBestName] gets up from her seat as soon as the last person arrives and locks the door, then turns around, pulling free a dagger and giving you all a crazed smile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_444;No! Get away from us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_445;One day one of the servants comes running and informs you that [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] are having an argument. You head over to them to see if you can salvage the situation, but it quickly becomes clear that that is not going to be possible as they truly seem to dislike one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_445;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_446;You come across [FromFrom.GetBestName] one day as you return from a meeting with [From.GetBestName]. Out of politeness, you inquire about her day, and for some reason she takes it poorly and accuses you of always treating her poorly. The situation quickly gets worse from there on, and soon you are both shouting at each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_446;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_448;One day [From.GetBestName] asks to speak to you. She tells you that while she is fond of you she has been considering matters of religion recently, and she has realized that she would prefer to take monastic vows and enter into the service of the Buddha.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_448;If that is your wish...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_448;I forbid it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_449;Though [FromFrom.GetBestName] has not brought up the matter of taking monastic vows again, she has become rather distant, and though you remain fond of her it seems that she no longer feels the same way about you. Perhaps that will change in the future, but you feel anything but certain about that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_449;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_450;The day after your conversation with [From.GetBestName] you discover a sealed envelope addressed to you in your office, clearly written in her handwriting. Opening it, you discover that it is a note informing you that she has seen fit to head elsewhere in search of enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_450;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_451;Ever since you first came to know her [From.GetBestName] has been known to get sick on almost a weekly basis. It has usually not been anything particularly serious, but every now and them she has had trouble recovering, and you just received word that she seems to be struggling with an illness at the moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_451;She really doesn't have it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nick_of_the_nine_tails;the Nine-Tailed Fox;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_455;As you grow older your kitsune powers continue to grow, bit by bit. Usually, it is not really something you pay attention to, but as you woke up with a new tail this morning you are confident that your power just grew significantly. The humans surrounding you are unlikely to notice anything, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_455;Such power!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_456;You have often heard humans speak of improving themselves, of changing who they are, whether in the name of spirituality, of glory, or of vanity. At times, you have found this appealing yourself, but as you are not human there is only so much you can change about yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_456;I can't fight my nature!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_457;While it can be fun to play with the emotions of several humans at the same time you feel that doing so has resulted in you being overly lax when it comes to keeping [kitsune_target.GetBestName] wrapped around your finger, and you have resolved to focus your efforts on addressing that matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_457;Time to focus...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_458;A message arrived from [From.GetBestName] today, informing you that she no longer feels quite the same way about you as she once did. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it seems that she wishes to keep you at a distance for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_458;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_459;[kitsune_target.GetBestName] and you have been at odds for some time, but as [kitsune_target.GetSheHe] is someone it is rather useful for you to keep close that is not really ideal, and you feel that only good things could come from moving on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_459;Time to end that nonsense...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_460;Though you and [From.GetBestName] have been at odds for some time you have always been somewhat fond of her, and today she approached you suggesting you should put the past behind you. You cannot recall quite what her arguments were, but they were quite convincing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_460;It was just a misunderstanding!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_461;[kitsune_target.GetBestName] and you have been drifting apart lately, and though you are confident that you could find other humans to wrap around your finger there is something special about [kitsune_target.GetBestName] that makes you want to keep [kitsune_target.GetHerHis] attentions focused on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_461;Time to turn on the charm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_462;[From.GetBestName] and you have been drifting apart lately as you had the feeling that she no longer was interested in you, but today she made certain to remind you just how much she cares about you, and your feelings for her certainly have not diminished.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_462;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_463;Though it is usually not terribly difficult for you to keep the attention of [kitsune_target.GetBestName] focused on you seeing as you have your kitsune powers available, [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] has been getting in the way of your plans quite a bit, and you are starting to wonder if [kitsune_rival.GetSheHe] should be taken care of permanently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_463;Accidents happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_463;...but not this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_464;As you are about to fall asleep one evening you hear the sound of movement nearby and a knock on your door. You get out of bed and hurry to the door to open it, finding [From.GetBestName] outside. You can see a foxlike tail sticking out behind her, which you barely have time to take in as she lunges at you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_464;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_465;You have just received word that [kitsune_rival.GetBestName] has been found dead in her quarters, killed by an unknown attacker. Word appears to spread quickly about the murder, as [From.GetBestName] comes to see you before long, telling you that she worries that someone might come after her next.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_465;I will keep you safe!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_466;Though your attention currently is focused on [kitsune_target.GetBestName] you know the value of ensuring that others respect you and appreciate your presence. Lately, you have been having quite a few interactions with [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName], and [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] truly seems to have enjoyed your company.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_466;I am good at this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_467;You have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] lately, and she truly is a fascinating woman, easily able to converse with you and others on a multitude of different subjects and always someone that can put a smile on both your face and the faces of others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_467;She's quite impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_468;You have noticed that [From.GetBestName] has been spending a lot of time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName] lately, and it seems [From.GetBestName] has found it quite enjoyable as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard praising [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s ability to provide entertaining conversation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_468;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_469;Though your attention currently is focused on [kitsune_target.GetBestName] you know the value of ensuring that others respect you and appreciate your presence. Unfotunately, [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] does not seem all that appreciative of your presence, and [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] might even suspect what you truly are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_469;I should have been more careful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_470;You have been spending some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] lately, and though she is a fascinating woman in many ways there is something about her that is just not quite right. You have not been able to put your finger on just what it is, but you probably should speak to [kitsune_target.GetBestName] about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_470;I must tell [kitsune_target.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_470;I'm not sure what I saw...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_471;You have noticed that [From.GetBestName] has been spending a lot of time in the company of [FromFrom.GetBestName] lately, and you had expected this to mean that they both enjoyed each other's company. However, it seems [From.GetBestName] thinks that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is not quite what she seems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_471;I don't believe [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_471;I will investigate this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_472;Though your warning about [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has reached [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] has apparently decided that you must be imagining things, as you have just received a letter telling you to not make such baseless accusations about [FromFromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_472;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_473;It seems [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] suspects more than you would have expected and that [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] has seen fit to share what [kitsune_courtier.GetSheHe] suspects with [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] just confronted you about the accusations that you are not quite what you seem to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_473;Time to end the charade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_473;Time to charm [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_474;You are able to locate [From.GetBestName] easily enough and quickly convince her to speak to you alone. When you reveal the accusations made by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName], [From.GetBestName] lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_474;It's all true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_475;You have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] confronted [FromFrom.GetBestName] about her unusual behaviour and that it turns out that you were right that something unusual was going on, seeing as [FromFrom.GetBestName] transformed into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_475;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_476;It does not take much more than a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of your kitsune powers to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the accusations made against you by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] do not hold up to scrutiny, and that you most definitely are only an ordinary human woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_476;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_477;[From.GetBestName] is clearly surprised by the accusations that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] has made against her, telling you that she had thought that the two of them were friends. After considering the matter for a moment, she suggests that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] feels threatened by a beautiful and brillant woman such as herself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_477;She's right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_478;You have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] has spoken to [FromFrom.GetBestName] and that there is no reason for you to be suspicious of her. Moreover, [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] seem to think that you are threatened by the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a beautiful and brillant woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_478;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_479;You had expected a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of your kitsune powers to be enough to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that the accusations made against you by [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] do not hold up to scrutiny, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] seems unaffected by your attempt to convince [From.GetHerHim] and demands answers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_479;I tire of this game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_480;[From.GetBestName] initially claims surprised by the accusations that [kitsune_courtier.GetBestName] has made against her, but after you refuse to drop the matter she lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_480;It's all true!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_481;You have just received word from [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] confronted [FromFrom.GetBestName] about her unusual behaviour and that it turns out that you were right that something unusual was going on, seeing as [FromFrom.GetBestName] transformed into a many-tailed fox before running off into the distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_481;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_482;You have known [From.GetBestName] for many years, and yet you are convinced that she looks very much the same as when you first met her, even though that seems impossible. Maybe she is using some kind of cosmetics you are unfamiliar with, or it is a trick of the light, but it might also be something rather less mundane.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_482;I'm imagining things...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_482;I need to ask her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_483;One of the disadvantages with staying in the same place for as long as you have is that people might start to notice that everything about you is not as it seems, and [From.GetBestName] has just confronted you about the fact that you do not seem to age at quite the same rate as anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_483;Time to end the charade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_483;Time to charm [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_484;You confront [From.GetBestName] about her unchanging appearance, and to your surprise she does not bother to attempt to defend herself. Instead, she lets out an annoyed sigh and turns into a many-tailed fox, and then she runs off into the distance before you can react to what just happened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_484;I should have known!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_485;It does not take much more than a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of your kitsune powers to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is imagining things, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is quick to apologize, telling you that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] clearly is mistaken.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_485;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_486;[From.GetBestName] is clearly surprised when you ask her about her unchanging appearance and is quick to point out that there are others around that have changed very little over the years as well. You consider her words and become more and more convinced that everything is as it should be and that nothing strange is going on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_486;Nothing to see here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_487;You had expected a few words, a quick touch, and the merest fraction of your kitsune powers to be enough to convince [FromFrom.GetBestName] that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is imagining things, but [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is not so easily dissuaded, and it has become clear that you really have been staying in one place for far too long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_487;This ends now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_488;[From.GetBestName] seems surprised when you ask her about her unchanging appearance, but when you refuse to drop the matter until she presents an explanation she lets out an annoyed sigh and transforms into a many-tailed fox. You are so surprised by this that you do not notice that she has taken off running until she is far away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_488;I did not expect that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_489;There are many games kitsunes can play with humans, and some of them might seem a bit cruel. However, they all serve one purpose or another, and though it would be hard to explain the reasons why you have started to consider whether [kitsune_target.GetBestName] should suffer a bout of illness just about now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_489;I have my needs...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_489;...but I don't need this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_490;When you woke up in the morning you felt ready to take on the world, but over the course of the day you have become unwell, seemingly for no good reason. [From.GetBestName] has noticed this, and she has promised to do everything she can to help you recover as quickly as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_490;I'm glad she's here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_491;[kitsune_lesson_target.GetBestName] is growing up fast, and [kitsune_lesson_target.GetSheHe] probably does not suspect your true nature or the fact that it might result in trouble for [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] in the future. To help [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] survive, you have decided to give [kitsune_lesson_target.GetHerHim] a few lessons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_491;Mother knows best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_492;Your mother, [From.GetBestName], took you on a trip to the forest today. Once there, she told you that she wanted to teach you a lesson to prepare you for the future, as there are those in the world that might resent you simply because you are her child. The lesson was a bit odd, but you had fun, and you learned some things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_492;Mother knows best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_493;Though you spend a lot of your time in the company of [kitsune_target.GetBestName] and others you occasionally find the opportunity to slip away for a few hours to visit the forest nearby, and particularly the foxes found in it. One day when you are enjoying their company a servant comes to find you, and she notices the foxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_493;I was just taking a walk!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_494;Today one of your servants requested a moment of time to speak to you about [From.GetBestName]. Surprised by this request, you saw fit to grant it, and it turns out that the servant saw [From.GetBestName] spending time with a group of foxes in the forest earlier in the day and thought you would want to hear about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_494;Strange, but harmless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_495;One of the many powers you have as a kitsune is the power to enter the dreams of unsuspecting humans. This night, you have decided to enter the dreams of [kitsune_dream_target.GetBestName], purely out of curiosity. You do not discover anything of interest, but you had the chance to affect what was happening a little, which was fun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_495;That was time well spent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_496;You do not tend to pay a lot of attention to your dreams, particularly not as you do not remember too many of them, but this night you had some very strange dreams involving various people you know, including [From.GetBestName], whose presence was significantly more pronounced than that of many others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_496;Such curious dreams...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_497;Though there are many reasons to seduce humans, including mere fun and the possibility of ensuring offspring, it is also a good way for a kitsune to replenish some of her magical energy, and today you made sure to drag [kitsune_target.GetBestName] into a secluded area for that purpose, keeping [kitsune_target.GetHerHim] there for hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_497;I needed that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_498;[From.GetBestName] tends to be quite eager to make love to you, but you rarely find her as eager as she was today. She was quite insistent that you come with her into a secluded area where you would not be bothered, and once she had managed to get you where she wanted you she made sure to keep you there for several hours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_498;That was... exhausting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_499;Though your power is not inconsiderable there are those that seem all but unaffected by them. One such person is [kitsune_priest.GetBestName], who visited [kitsune_target.GetBestName] today to discuss matters of religion, and though you did your best to avoid [kitsune_priest.GetBestName] [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] seemed quite suspicious of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_499;[kitsune_priest.GetSheHeCap] might know too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_500;[kitsune_priest.GetBestName] visited you today to discuss various matters of faith, which took up a considerable part of your day. After [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] had left, [From.GetBestName] came to see you, saying that she would prefer if [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] did not visit again as she finds [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] quite disagreeable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_500;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_501;[kitsune_priest.GetBestName] seems to be suspecting that you are not quite human, as some of the people you have convinced to watch [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] have reported that [kitsune_priest.GetSheHe] has been looking into mythological creatures lately and often has been heard muttering your name while doing so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_501;Time for [kitsune_priest.GetHerHim] to die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_502;Word reached you today that [kitsune_priest.GetBestName] has been found dead and that many books about mythological beasts that were known to have been in [kitsune_priest.GetHerHis] possession have gone missing. [From.GetBestName] seems quite interested in the matter, and has instructed those investigating the murder to keep her informed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_502;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_503;It is somewhat embarrassing for you to have been imprisoned in the first place, but today you finally put your escape plan in motion. Your kitsune powers were more than sufficient for the task, and it is unlikely that anyone will be able to figure out just how you escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_503;Free at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_504;As you are dealing with various routine matters one of your guards comes running and requests to speak to you, clearly distraught. You grant the request and learn that [From.GetBestName], formerly your prisoner, seems to have vanished without a trace, and that no one has been able to figure out how she got out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_504;I need better guards, it seems...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_505;Today [From.GetBestName] returned unexpectedly, having escaped captivity. She claims to have escaped because of the lax security measures put into place to keep her locked up, and knowing that guards often are not as eager to carry out their jobs as one would expect that could certainly be true.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_505;I don't need the details...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_507;Growing up, you have heard many people tell you that they always have considered your mother a rather strange woman. Some of the things they have told you have seemed strange indeed, and as you woke up discovering that you somehow had grown a fox tail overnight you come to realize that your mother is not exactly a human woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_507;This explains so much!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##### Moon Princess
EVTDESC_JAPAN_511;Word has arrived that a strange woman has arrived nearby recently. The rumours you have had are quite contradictory, but they all seem to agree that she has highly unusual hair, and most of the rumours claim that she might be from the Moon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_511;I will check this out myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_511;This can't be important...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_512;You have arrived in the area where the woman with the strange hair supposedly can be found, and you have no difficulty locating her. Her hair truly is unusual, seeing as it is pink of all things. Introducing herself as Kaguya, the woman claims that she is in the area because she has received a message that some people might need help.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_512;Let me know if I can be of assistance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_512;I don't have time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_513;Some time after you visited her you receive a message from the pink-haired woman known as Kaguya. She informs you that she has been able to determine that the people she was there to assist can be found elsewhere, and as such she will be departing from the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_513;Safe voyage!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_514;Some time after you visited her you receive a message from the pink-haired woman known as Kaguya. She claims that she will need access to various rare materials in order to be able to help the people that requested her assistance, and she is wondering whether you might be able to provide those materials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_514;I can provide the money, at least!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_514;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_515;You have received another message from Kaguya, the strange pink-haired woman you met before. She regrets to inform you that she was unable to find the supplies she needed in the area and will be looking for them elsewhere. The messenger that delivered the message claims that the woman that gave it to him flew off in a strange iron contraption.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_515;What?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_516;Kaguya, the strange pink-haired woman you met before, requests that you come visit her. When you arrive she hands you a large book, telling you that it is payment for services rendered. The book turns out to contain highly advanced knowledge, some of which might explain the strange iron contraption you saw flying off as you were departing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_516;This... this changes everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
##### Scandalous Saio/Saiin
EVTDESC_JAPAN_518;As an Imperial Priestess, you are expected to remain a virgin until such a time that you are replaced. Unfortunately, it seems word has gotten out that you might not be as much of a virgin as you are supposed to be, which reflects poorly on you and on the Chrysanthemum Throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_518;Um, oops?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_519;As an Imperial Priestess, [From.GetBestName] is supposed to remain a virgin until she is replaced. However, rumour has it that this is not the case, which reflects poorly on both her and on the Chrysanthemum Throne, and the expectation is that you will address the situation appropriately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_519;Replace her at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_519;Recall her at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_519;Leave her be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

##### Foreigner on your Shores
EVTDESC_JAPAN_520;The peasants in [foreigner_landfall_province.GetName] recently encountered a foreign shipwreck. One of the surviving members of the crew is [foreigner_in_japan.GetBestName], a [foreigner_in_japan.GetManWoman] supposedly from [foreigner_origin_province.GetName]. [foreigner_in_japan.GetSheHeCap] has indicated that [foreigner_in_japan.GetSheHe] wishes to enter your service.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_520;Foreginers are not welcome here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_520;I welcome you to my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_522;You have recently been spending some time in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName], and though the two of you had little knowledge of one another previously you are getting along quite well. In fact, you think the two of you are becoming friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_522;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_523;You recently spent some time in the company of [From.GetBestName]. Though [From.GetSheHe] was something of an unknown to you previously, you feel that the two already have become friends, seeing as you seem to share quite a few opinions and interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_523;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_524;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [foreigners_target.GetBestName] have gotten quite close as of late. It certainly is good to know that [From.GetBestName] can make friends this far from home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_524;Good for them, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_525;You have recently been spending some time in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName], and though the two of you had little knowledge of one another previously you have discovered that you could not be more different, and [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] is certainly not someone you want to speak to again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_525;Go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_526;You recently spent some time in the company of [From.GetBestName]. Though [From.GetSheHe] was something of an unknown to you previously, you already feel that you know more than enough about [From.GetHerHim], seeing as [From.GetSheHe] is a thoroughly unpleasant individual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_526;Go away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_527;The latest court gossip that has reached your ears indicate that [From.GetBestName] and [foreigners_target.GetBestName] hate each other. You had thought they were mostly unaware of each other, but it is possible that that has changed recently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_527;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_528;Though you have long known that [From.GetBestName] considers [From.GetHerselfHimself] something of a warrior you were still quite surprised when [From.GetSheHe] approached you today and asked you to help [From.GetHerHim] join the Warriors of the Rising Sun, as that certainly is not what you would expect from a foreigner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_528;I will vouch for you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_528;I will train you myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_528;You don't deserve such an honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_529;[From.GetBestName] has let you know that [From.GetSheHe] will vouch for you and that the Warriors of the Rising Sun should be willing to let you join based on that. [From.GetSheHeCap] has told you that this is quite the honor, and that [From.GetSheHe] expects great things from you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_529;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_530;[From.GetBestName] has let you know that [From.GetSheHe] not only will support you when it comes to joining the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but that [From.GetSheHe] is going to handle your trainign [From.GetHerselfHimself], which certainly is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_530;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_531;[From.GetBestName] laughed at your request to join the Warriors of the Rising Sun and firmly told you that [From.GetSheHe] considers you unworthy of that honor and that the Warriors of the Rising Sun doubtlessly agree with [From.GetHerHis] assessment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_531;Such arrogance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_532;One day while you are on the road several armed bandits approach you, clearly with ill intentions in mind. It is still possible for you to get away from them before they are close, but if running is unappealing you might also meet them head on with your weapon at the ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_532;Time to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_532;Time to run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_533;The bandits are taken by complete surprise by your attack, and several of them fall before they realize that you have closed with them. The rest attempt to fight back, but their attempt to do so is quite feeble indeed, and soon you are the only one still on your feet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_533;A simple matter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_534;[From.GetBestName] returned home in good spirits today. Asked about it, [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] encountered some bandits on the road, and that the ensuing fight went completely in [From.GetHerHis] favor, which made it a rather enjoyable encounter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_534;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_535;The bandits are taken by surprise by your attack, and one of them falls before they realize that you have closed with them. The rest attempt to fight back, but it does not really matter in the end. However, you are injured in the fight, so it was not as clean a victory as it could have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_535;That hurt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_536;One day [From.GetBestName] returns to the castle somewhat injured but still reasonably happy. [From.GetSheHeCap] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] came across some bandits and that [From.GetSheHe] was injured in the ensuing fight. Seeing as the fight ended in victory, it could have gone worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_536;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_537;The bandits are ready when you move to attack them, and you get wounded quite quickly. Eventually, you manage to get the upper hand against them and force them all to run or die, but at that point you have taken a grievous wound that you doubt you ever truly will recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_537;They almost got me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_538;Today [From.GetBestName] returned home badly injured. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quickly tended to by various servants, even if they are unable to do much for [From.GetHerHim], and based on what they tell you [From.GetBestName] apparently fought a large number of bandits single-handedly and barely prevailed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_538;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_539;The bandits are ready when you move to attack them, and you get badly wounded early on in the battle. You do your best to fight on, but there are many of them, and weight of numbers alone can decide a fight. It does not take long before you are lying on the ground, bleeding from several fatal wounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_539;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_540;A messenger arrrived outside the gates today, carrying a message informing you that the body of [From.GetBestName] has been found on the road. Based on the injuries on the body and the fact that it was stripped clean of all valuables, you suspect it to be the work of bandits, even if you might never know for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_540;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_541;[From.GetBestName] returned home today, clearly quite shaken, as [From.GetSheHe] claims that there are bandits behind [From.GetHerHim]. Though it is possible that there might be bandits nearby, you doubt that they are as many as [From.GetSheHe] claims, and as far as you are concerned [From.GetSheHe] should have fought them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_541;How cowardly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_542;One evening when you are having a drink in a local tavern one of the locals bumps into you and causes you to spill your drink all over yourself. You turn around and demand an apology, but the man just laughs and claims that you spilled your drink yourself, seeing as you are a foreign savage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_542;Now you've done it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_543;At first, it is just you and the man that bumped into you that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. Given that the man that bumped into you is unconscious and you are not, things went quite well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_543;Worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_544;At first, it is just you and the man that bumped into you that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. You, the man that bumped into you, and several others have taken some injuries in the fighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_544;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_545;At first, it is just you and the man that bumped into you that are fighting, but the fighting soon spreads throughout the tavern, drawing in more and more of the locals. Eventually, the local town watch has to intervene, dragging everyone outside. By that point, you have taken a fairly serious wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_545;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_546;A messenger has arrived from the owner of a local tavern. The man is apparently quite upset with [From.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] seems to have started a brawl the other night, and now demands that something is done about [From.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] apprently has brawled before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_546;Brawls happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_546;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_546;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_547;You have long known that [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has ambitions to become known as a great warrior, but though [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] certainly has some skill you feel that there are things you could teach [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] as some of the techniques familiar to you might be useful against opponents that have never encountered them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_547;Let me teach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_548;[From.GetBestName] approached you today, suggesting that [From.GetSheHe] could teach you a few fighting moves unlike anything you are familiar with. Given that [From.GetSheHe] is a foreigner, it is quite likely that [From.GetSheHe] knows some exotic techniques, but it would perhaps be a bit embarrassing to get a lesson from [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_548;I accept your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_548;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_549;You have just received word that [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have been seen practicing swordfighting together. It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] was the teacher, which is a bit odd, but [From.GetBestName] apparently was content with that arrangement, and [From.GetSheHe] might have learned some foreign tricks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_549;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_550;One day when you are visiting a local market some of the locals ask you how you like it in the area. You tell them that you rather like it but that there are some things that simply are not as good as they are back where you grew up. This does not seem to be what they wanted to hear, as they get quite angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_550;Maybe I misspoke...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_551;You have just received word that the peasants in [foreigners_target_province.GetName] have gotten restless as a result of [From.GetBestName]'s latest visit. Apparently, [From.GetBestName] said that [From.GetSheHe] wished for dishonor on the peasants, their whole families, and their cows, as well as several other insulting things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_551;Ignore the peasant rabble!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_551;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_551;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_552;[From.GetBestName] has always implied that [From.GetSheHe] possesses quite a bit of useful knowledge from back where [From.GetSheHe] originally came from, even if [From.GetSheHe] rarely has shown this to be true. However, today [From.GetSheHe] proved [From.GetHerHis] knowledge by offering several useful suggestions during a meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_552;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_553;One day when you are in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] you realize that there are things that you know that [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] does not. Perhaps it would be qise to share those insights, seeing as you are a guest in this foreign land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_553;Let me teach you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_554;One day when you are in the company of [From.GetBestName] [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps [From.GetSheHe] could be permitted to share some insights regarding some matters that [From.GetSheHe] picked up some useful knowledge about back home. Perhaps it would be embarrassing to accept, but it might also be useful, so maybe it is a good idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_554;I accept your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_554;I don't need your help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_555;You have just received word that [From.GetBestName] apparently has been taught some things by [FromFrom.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] apparently did not know as much as the foreigner. You are sure that there are those that would consider the need for such a lesson embarrassing, but maybe the information learned is worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_555;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_556;Your experiences while staying at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] have been many, and some of them have taught you quite a few things. As a result you have been composing a book about certain things, and now it is finally ready to be given to your host.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_JAPAN_562;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_562;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_563;As you are a foreigner at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] there are many that consider you utterly irrelevant and that perhaps underestimate you. As a result, people are sometimes careless around you, and that has allowed you to notice that some people, such as [foreigners_target.GetBestName], are up to unsavory things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_563;I saw that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_564;It seems [From.GetBestName], the foreigner who has been living in [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court for some time, is paying more attention to what goes on than you would have expected, as [From.GetSheHe] apparently has noticed your plot and has seen fit to tell [foreigners_host.GetBestName] all about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_564;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_565;[FromFrom.GetBestName] sought an audience with you today, wishing to speak to you about [From.GetBestName]. Once the two of you were in private, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] shared some information [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has managed to uncover concerning a plot that [From.GetBestName] is involved with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_565;Good to know!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_566;Many of the courtiers in [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court are quite wealthy, and some of them are a bit careless when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible to get into their quarters, including [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. Anyone could break in and take what is there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_566;I will take what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_567;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take you long to locate some valuables. While it would be tempting to take some of the more unique items you have found inside, you realize that it is harder to prove anything regarding money, and thus you elect to steal some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_567;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_568;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take you long to locate some valuables. However, before you can depart [foreigners_target.GetBestName] returns, catching you inside [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] room and demanding that you leave at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_568;I must have gotten lost!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_569;[foreigners_target.GetBestName] has publicly accused [From.GetBestName] of breaking into [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] quarters, supposedly for no good reason. [From.GetBestName] has come up with several excuses for having been there, but they all are a bit contradictory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_569;It was probably a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_569;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_569;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_570;Many of the vassals visiting [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court are quite wealthy, and some of them are a bit careless when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible to get into their quarters, including [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. Anyone could break in and take what is there...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_570;I will take what I can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_571;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take you long to locate some valuables. While it would be tempting to take some of the more unique items you have found inside, you realize that it is harder to prove anything regarding money, and thus you elect to steal some gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_571;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_572;As you return to your quarters you realize that someone has been inside and that some of the money you had left there is missing. Asking around, nobody seems to have seen anyone nearby, and you resign yourself to the fact that the thief probably never will be caught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_572;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_573;It is a simple enough matter to enter into [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s quarters, and once inside it does not take you long to locate some valuables. However, before you can depart [foreigners_target.GetBestName]'s guards return, catching you inside [foreigners_target.GetHerHis] room and easily subduing and imprisoning you.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_573;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_574;As you return to your quarters you send in your guards ahead of you to look for any possible threats lurking inside. To your surprise, they soon drag out [From.GetBestName], who apparently was in the process of stealing some of the valuables inside. As it is clear that [From.GetSheHe] had no reason to be there, you order [From.GetHerHim] thrown in a cell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_574;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_575;You have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has imprisoned [FromFrom.GetBestName] after catching [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the middle of an attempt to steal some valuables from inside [From.GetHerHis] personal quarters. You see no real reason to interfere in the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_575;That's what thieves deserve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_576;There are many attractive people at the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName], but of late your attention has primarily turned to [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. [foreigners_target.GetSheHeCap] certainly is an intriguing [foreigners_target.GetManWoman], and it might be interesting to get to know [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_576;I will make an attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_576;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_577;Today you were approached by [From.GetBestName], the foreigner who has been living in the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] for some time. [From.GetSheHeCap] made it quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get to know you more intimately, and that [From.GetSheHe] knows of a secluded place nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_577;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_577;You and me? Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_578;[From.GetBestName] was not as receptive to your suggestion that the two of you should leave for some place more private so that you could get to know each other intimately as you would have hoped, and has made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for you to ask again later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_578;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_579;[From.GetBestName] was as receptive to your suggestion that the two of you should leave for some place more private so that you could get to know each other intimately as you had hoped, and it was not terribly difficult to find such a place. Some time later, as you are getting dressed, the matter of the future is brought up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_579;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_579;It won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_580;There are many attractive people in the realm of [foreigners_host.GetBestName], but of late your attention has primarily turned to [foreigners_target.GetBestName]. [foreigners_target.GetSheHeCap] certainly is an intriguing [foreigners_target.GetManWoman], and it might be interesting to get to know [foreigners_target.GetHerHim] more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_580;I will make an attempt!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_580;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_581;Today you were approached by [From.GetBestName], the foreigner who has been living in the court of [foreigners_host.GetBestName] for some time. [From.GetSheHeCap] made it quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get to know you more intimately, and that [From.GetSheHe] knows of a secluded place nearby...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JAPAN_583;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_583;It won't happen again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_584;You and [From.GetBestName] share a rather enjoyable time together away from the eyes of all others. When you are getting dressed again you discuss the matter of what happens next, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that you should meet again as soon as it can be arranged, seeing as you both had a good time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_584;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_585;You and [From.GetBestName] share a rather enjoyable time together away from the eyes of all others. When you are getting dressed again you discuss the matter of what happens next, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that you should not make a habit out of it, seeing as it sooner or later would attract attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_585;Maybe for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_586;The foreigner, [From.GetBestName], has been visiting [foreigners_target_province.GetName] frequently over the past month, making some small investments and suggesting how the locals can improve things in various areas. It is already starting to yield some promising results, as best you can tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_586;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_587;One day when you are in the company of [foreigners_target.GetBestName] you forget just what the proper etiquette for that situation would be and make a mess of the situation. You try to smooth things over, but it becomes clear that it will take time before your careless words are forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_587;That could have gone better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_588;You spent some time with [From.GetBestName], the foreigner living in [foreigners_host.GetBestName]'s court, today, and though [From.GetSheHe] usually knows what not to do [From.GetSheHe] was rather careless as [From.GetSheHe] spoke today, and some things [From.GetSheHe] said were quite insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_588;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_589;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been causing trouble recently as [From.GetBestName] has been heard complaining about [FromFrom.GetHerHim] insulting [From.GetHerHim]. Normally, this would not concern you, but as [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a foreigner living in your court [FromFrom.GetHerHis] actions reflect poorly on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_589;It was probably a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_589;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_589;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_JAPAN_593;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_593;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_593;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_594;Though it never seemed particularly likely to you that [From.GetBestName] would be as useful to you as someone not from a foreign land [From.GetSheHe] has proven to be even less useful than you expected. It is quite embarrassing, really, to have seen fit to keep [From.GetHerHim] around in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_594;Not everything goes as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_595;Unlike most people, you are meant for great things, or so the voices only you can hear tell you. Now [foreigners_target.GetBestName] has become a threat to your destiny, and [foreigners_target.GetSheHe] needs to be removed without delay, or so the voices tell you at least.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_595;As the voices command!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_596;One evening as you are about to fall asleep you hear movement inside your quarters. Turning towards the sound, you discover [From.GetBestName] standing over you, a dagger at the ready. [From.GetSheHeCap] moves to attack you before you can react, and by the time the guards arrive it is much too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_596;This cannot be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_597;You have received word that [From.GetBestName] was murdered in [From.GetHerHis] bed by none other than [FromFrom.GetBestName], who was caught at the scene. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] does not deny it, and instead merely claims that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] did what the voices told [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_597;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_597;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Turning towards the sound, you discover [From.GetBestName] standing over you, a dagger at the ready. [From.GetSheHeCap] moves to attack you, but luckily enough you manage to keep [From.GetHerHim] at bay until the guards can arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_598;I barely survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_599;You have received word that [From.GetBestName] almost was murdered in [From.GetHerHis] bed by none other than [FromFrom.GetBestName], who was caught at the scene. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] does not deny it, and instead merely claims that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] did what the voices told [FromFrom.GetHerHim] to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_599;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_599;Throw [From.GetHerHim] in a cell!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_599;Off with [From.GetHerHis] head!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_600;The voices are restless today. They tell you that it is a time for change. At first, you have trouble realizing what they mean, but then you realize that it is time for you to become a [foreigners_target_province.Culture.GetName] [foreigners_target_province.Religion.GetName], as that is a massive improvement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_600;New day, new me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_601;You have long suspected that [From.GetBestName] is not quite right in the head, and this suspicion only grew stronger after you met [From.GetHerHim] today. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] has decided that [From.GetSheHe] now will adhere to the customs of the [From.Culture.GetName] and the teachings of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_601;How does that make sense?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_602;[From.GetBestName] has been in your court for quite some time now, and has shown an interest in local customs and beliefs almost since [From.GetSheHe] arrived. Today you learned that [From.GetSheHe] finally has seen fit to embrace the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and all of its teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_602;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_603;[From.GetBestName] has been in your court for quite some time now, and has shown an interest in local customs and beliefs almost since [From.GetSheHe] arrived. Today you learned that [From.GetSheHe] finally has seen fit to embrace the [Root.Religion.GetName] culture and all of its customs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_603;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_605;Today you were approached by [From.GetBestName], the foreigner who has been living in your court for a while. [From.GetSheHeCap] told you that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get married, and that [From.GetSheHe] ideally wants to marry [foreigners_choice.GetBestName] as they already are quite close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_605;I think you two belong together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_605;You should marry my family!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_605;You should marry a servant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_605;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_606;Today you were approached by [From.GetBestName], the foreigner who has been living in your court for a while. [From.GetSheHeCap] told you that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to get married, but that [From.GetSheHe] has not found a suitable spouse yet, and that your help would be most appreciated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_606;I have a candidate in mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_606;You should marry my family!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_606;You should marry a servant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_606;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_1;With the Tohoku region once more at peace, it is time to decide what to do with the land I have acquired as part of the peace deal. If I'm not keeping it, I should also withdraw from the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_1;The land belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_1;The land belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GOSANNEN_1;The land belongs to the Kiyohara clan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GOSANNEN_1;The land belongs to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_GOSANNEN_1;The land belongs to the Regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_GOSANNEN_1;The land belongs to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_2;Despite my assistance in the war and my rightful claim it seems like [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that Mutsu is the rightful property of Fujiwara Kiyohira. Maybe I should dispute this by force of arms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_2;No, there shall be peace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_2;Summon my warriors! We march to Mutsu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_3;Though it was unclear at first if [From.GetBestName] would see fit to accept Fujiwara Kiyohira being the ruler of Mutsu [From.GetSheHe] seems to have accepted my decision, and has even reached an agreement declaring a lasting truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_3;My work here is done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_4;It seems [From.GetBestName] is unwilling to accept the fact that Mutsu rightfully belongs to Fujiwara Kiyohira and my decision to turn it over, as [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to declare war to press [From.GetHerHis] claim on the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_4;I defeated your kinsman, and I will defeat you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_5;Though I initially feared that [From.GetBestName] would have seen fit to keep Mutsu or to hand it off to someone else I have learned that [From.GetSheHe] is prepared to hand it over to me, recognizing my legal claim.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_5;I am glad [From.GetSheHe] saw reason!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_6;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance, which apparently is agreeable to all involved parties.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_6;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_6;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_7;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I had been given control of the Tohoku region as a whole. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really want to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_7;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_7;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_8;Despite my assistance in the war and my rightful claim it seems like [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to declare that [From.GetSheHe] should remain in control of Mutsu to ensure a lasting peace. Maybe I should dispute this by force of arms?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_8;No, there shall be peace...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_8;Summon my warriors! We march to Mutsu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_9;I intially feared that [From.GetBestName] would oppose my decision to retain control over Mutsu, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] has seen reason as [From.GetSheHe] even was willing to sign a treaty stipulating a lasting truce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_9;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_10;It seems [From.GetBestName] views [From.GetHerHis] personal glory as more important than what is best for the Chrysanthemum Throne, as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to accept my decision to retain control over Mutsu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_10;I defeated your kinsman, and I will defeat you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_11;[From.GetBestName] has finally secured peace in the Tohoku region, and instead of giving Mutsu to one of the claimants or keeping it for [From.GetHerselfHimself] [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to turn over the land to me so that I may distribute it as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_11;If only all subjects were this loyal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_12;To my great surprise, it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance. It would be seen as treasonous to object to this peace settlement, but I should not forget this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_12;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] should have given it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_13;Though it seemed doubtful at first, I have managed to come out ahead in the Northern Disturbance, and now I control the Tohoku region. Since the region is at peace, I doubt the Chrysanthemum Throne will object.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_13;I think this is quite satisfactory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_14;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being the victor. [From.GetSheHeCap] is now in firm control of the Tohoku region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_14;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_14;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_15;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I control the Tohoku region as a whole due to my recent victory. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really need to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_15;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_15;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_16;With the Tohoku region finally at peace, I need to decide whether I wish to remain in the region or if I should hand it over to someone else and focus on other matters in or near the capital.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_16;I will give the north to Fujiwara Kiyohira!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_16;I will keep the north!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_GOSANNEN_16;I will give the north to the Regent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_GOSANNEN_16;I will give the north to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_17;I have just received word that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to recognize my rightful claim to the Tohoku region following the end of the Northern Disturbance and that [From.GetSheHe] will depart the region, leaving it in my capable hands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_17;This will surely please everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_18;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being granted control of the region following [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s victory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_18;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_18;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_19;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I control the Tohoku region as a whole. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really need to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_19;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_19;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_20;Despite previous assurances to that effect, [From.GetBestName] has not seen fit to give me control of the Tohoku region following [From.GetHerHis] recent victory in the Northern Disturbance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_20;I won't forget this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_21;[From.GetBestName] has finally secured peace in the Tohoku region, and [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to turn over the land [From.GetSheHe] obtained to me so that I may distribute it as I see fit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_21;If only all subjects were this loyal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_22;To my great surprise, it seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to turn over Mutsu to [From.GetBestName] following the end of the Northern Disturbance. It would be seen as treasonous to object to this peace settlement, but I should not forget this slight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_22;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] should have given it to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_23;I have managed to come out ahead in the Northern Disturbance, and now I control the Tohoku region. Since the region is at peace, I doubt the Chrysanthemum Throne will object to this outcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_23;I think this is quite satisfactory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_24;I have just received word from the Tohoku region that the Northern Disturbance has come to an end, with [From.GetBestName] being the victor. [From.GetSheHeCap] is now in firm control of the Tohoku region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_24;That's good news, I suppose...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_24;The north is irrelevant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_25;Word has reached me that [From.GetBestName] was not particularly interested to learn that I now control the Tohoku region as a whole due to my recent victory. If [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in what happens here, do I really want to remain an imperial subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_25;I am loyal to the Chrysanthemum Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_GOSANNEN_25;I will create my own realm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_GOSANNEN_26;With my realm finally at peace again the warrior bands that came to my aid are no longer needed, and it is time for them to disperse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_GOSANNEN_26;I can bring them back if I need them again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
