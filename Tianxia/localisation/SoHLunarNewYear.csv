use_dark_power_if_necessary;Call upon the power of darkness, should it prove necessary, even if it might arouse suspicion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_2;It would not be a proper Lunar New Year celebration without a dragon dance happening during it. However, the specifics as to the size of the dragon or even whether there should be only one dragon is for you to determine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_2;I want the smallest dragon possible!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_2;Get me a regular-sized dragon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_2;Two dragons are better than one!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_LNY_2;I want the full nine dragons!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_3;While part of the Lunar New Year celebration will be private and only feature you and your highborn guests, doing something extra to entertain the townspeople might not be a bad idea. Do you wish to hire some musicians for this purpose?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_3;That seems like a good idea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_3;I would rather save the money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_4;Hiring some acrobats to entertain you and your guests might help spice up the Lunar New Year celebration. Of course, they are not considered as essential as some other parts of the festivities, so you might also elect not to hire them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_4;Acrobats? Sign me up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_4;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_5;Much like the dragon dance, fireworks are considered essential during the Lunar New Year celebration. The amount of fireworks that would be proper is hard to determine, and it mainly comes down to how much money you wish to spend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_5;Get as few as possible;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_5;Get a decent amount;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_5;Spend a little extra;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_LNY_5;Spend a lot more than expected;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_6;In addition to the dragon dance it is possible to also hire some entertainers to perform a lion dance. This is generally consdiered less important, but it could still make the celebration of the Lunar New Year more memorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_6;I want there to be lion dances!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_6;I'd rather save the money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_7;In order for the Lunar New Year celebration to be as good as possible it might be a good idea to invest in decorations. However, considering all the other expenses, you might also wish to save the money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_7;Saving the money is best;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_7;Some decorations would be nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_7;I want a lot of decorations;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_8;While it is not a tradition that is practiced everywhere there are those that hand out red envelopes filled with money during the Lunar New Year without either the giver or the recipient knowing who gets which package. Do you wish to do this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_8;Yes! Let's do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_8;Give away money? Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_9;With most of the preparations out of the way, you need to decide on how much food you wish to serve your guests during the Lunar New Year celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_10;As nearly everything has been prepared it is high time to send out invitations for the guests you wish to have attend the Lunar New Year celebration, which of course includes all of your vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_11;[Root.GetChineseLetterBlessing], I hereby invite you to my Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_11;I'll be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_11;As if I would attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_12;My liege, I have no intention to take part in your Lunar New Year celebration as I would rather not spend any more time with you than necessary.\n\nBy my hand and seal,[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_13;It is customary to clean one's home before the Lunar New Year to ensure good luck, and you should probably consider doing so. However, with all the rest of the preparations you have made, perhaps you could be excused for not cleaning properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_13;Everything must be properly cleaned;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_13;Sweep away the most obvious dirt;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_13;A little dirt never hurt anyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_LNY_14;In the Light of Red Lanters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_14;[Root.Capital.GetName] is in a festive mood as the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] is coming to an end and the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is about to begin. The townspeople are out in the streets, dancing, drinking, and laughing, with performers on nearly every street corner.\n\nDespite the celebration of the Lunar New Year only just beginning the sky is still lit by the occasional firework as the more eager -- or perhaps the more drunken -- celebrants see no need to wait.\n\nThe guests have started to arrive, coming from far and wide, and you are certain that your servants soon will have their hands full with their demands. As far as you can tell, everything is in readiness, and you should relax and feel free to join the festivities, as long as you remember to greet your guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_14;Wishing you prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_LNY_15;In the Light of Red Lanters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_15;[From.Capital.GetName] is in a festive mood as the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] is coming to an end and the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is about to begin. The townspeople are out in the streets, dancing, drinking, and laughing, with performers on nearly every street corner.\n\nDespite the celebration of the Lunar New Year only just beginning the sky is still lit by the occasional firework as the more eager -- or perhaps the more drunken -- celebrants see no need to wait.\n\nThough it is unlikely that all of the guests have had the time to arrive yet, you are still greeted by [From.GetBestName] upon your arriva.\n\n"Wishing you prosperity!" [From.GetSheHe] exclaims, though it is hard to be sure if it is only due to tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_15;Wishing you prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_15;May you live in interesting times!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_15;Happy New Year!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_16;It is considered a good start to the new year if your home is clean, and [From.GetBestName] has certainly made sure that [From.GetHerHis] home is clean, as you can't seem to find even a hint of dust or grime.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_16;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_16;I don't really care...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_17;It seems [From.GetBestName] has taken note of how clean your home is, as [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard approving of it. Though it was time-consuming, it seems like your cleaning paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_17;I'm glad you like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_18;It is considered a good start to the new year if your home is clean, but [From.GetBestName] does not seem to have bothered with it, as you notice a good amount of dirt in several places in the quarters given to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_18;How inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_18;I've seen worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_19;It seems your efforts to clean your home were insufficient, as [From.GetBestName] has been heard complaining a bit about it by some of your servants. Perhaps it would have been wise to make more of an effort?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_19;As if you've never had a dirty home!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_20;While it is possible to miss some dirt while cleaning, it is clear to you that [From.GetBestName] has not even tried to give [From.GetHerHis] home a proper cleaning before the Lunar New Year celebration began.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_20;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_20;It would be rude to complain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_21;Though you suspected that there might be disparaging comments directed at your servants due to the lack of cleaning you are taken by surprise by [From.GetBestName] going so far as to loudly complain about it and to put the blame on you alone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_21;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_22;You had noticed that some parts of [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s home were a bit less clean than expected, but it is not until [From.GetBestName] publicly accuses [FromFrom.GetBestName] of not bothering to clean at all that you realize the true extent of the uncleanliness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_22;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_23;[From.GetBestName] has clearly invested a lot of money into making sure that the food at the Lunar New Year celebration is anything but sparse. You barely have time to finish your second dessert before a servant comes around and offers you a third.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_23;This is most agreeable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_23;I didn't like that at all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_23;Does it really matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_24;The food at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration is filling and not bland, but it is rather unremarkable compared to what you have experienced at other times. A servant lets you know that there will only be a single dessert, not two or more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_25;While there is food to be found at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration it is clear that there has not been a lot invested into it, as the portions are quite small and the taste is bland. There isn't even a single dessert, to your surprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_26;It seems the choice of food at your Lunar New Year celebration pleased [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard asking the servants to pass along [From.GetHerHis] compliments to the kitchens and a request for some recipes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_26;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_27;Apparently the food at your Lunar New Year celebration was not to everyone's liking. [From.GetBestName] has been complaining about it throughout the evening, even going as far as to suggest that you don't know how to hire a proper kitchen staff.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_27;Cease your complaining!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_28;[From.Capital.GetName] is extensively decorated for the Lunar New Year celebration, and it is clear that [From.GetBestName] has spared no expense to make certain that it is aesthetically pleasing and that [From.GetSheHe] has a good grasp of Feng Shui.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_28;How auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_28;That's rather unremarkable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_29;It seems [From.GetBestName] approves of the decorations for your Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] just complimented your taste and your grasp of Feng Shui. Though it was not inexpensive, the investment seems to have paid off.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_29;I'm happy you approve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_30;When looking at the decorations for the Lunar New celebration in [From.Capital.GetName] you realize that they are rather poor and that their placement leaves a lot to be desired. It is as if [From.GetBestName] never has heard of the concept of Feng Shui.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_30;How inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_30;It isn't that bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_31;Your choice of decorations for the Lunar New Year celebration apparently leave something to be desired as far as [From.GetBestName] is concerned. In fact, [From.GetSheHe] has been overheard suggesting that you never have heard of Feng Shui.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_31;Shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_32;Though the Lunar New Year celebration in [Root.Capital.GetName] is a perfect opportunity for you to relax it is also an opportunity for learning. Your grasp of stewardship is not that great, but you know that [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetName] has some skill in that area. Perhaps you should ask [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetHerHim] for a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_32;It wouldn't hurt to ask...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_32;Let's not bother [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetHerHim]...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_33;Your liege, [From.GetBestName], approaches you in private during the Lunar New Year celebration to ask if you would consider giving [From.GetHerHim] a quick lesson concerning matters of stewardship, as [From.GetSheHe} has heard that you are well versed in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_33;I would be happy to help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_33;I'd rather take it easy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_33;I'll teach [From.GetHerHim] a lesson, to be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_34;[From.GetBestName] was open to giving you a few quick pointers regarding matters of stewardship, and you find that you have a somewhat better grasp of the subject after the lesson, which surely will be a benefit during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_34;This is to my liking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_35;It seems [From.GetBestName] would prefer to relax during the Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to give any lessons on the subject of stewardship for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_35;Not what I wanted to hear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_36;You are happy to hear that [From.GetBestName] is willing to teach you a lesson and leave the meeting certain that you will be able to use what [From.GetSheHe] taught you. Unfortunately, you quickly realize that [From.GetBestName]'s advice is very poor, which might be detrimental during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_36;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_37;Though the Lunar New Year celebration in [From.Capital.GetName] is a perfect opportunity for you to relax it is also an opportunity for learning. Your grasp of stewardship is not that great, but you know that [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetName] has some skill in that area. Perhaps you should ask [lny_stewardship_teacher.GetHerHim] for a lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_38;[From.GetBestName] approaches you in private during the Lunar New Year celebration to ask if you would consider giving [From.GetHerHim] a quick lesson concerning matters of stewardship, as [From.GetSheHe} has heard that you are well versed in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_39;[From.GetBestName] was open to giving you a few quick pointers regarding matters of stewardship, and you find that you have a somewhat better grasp of the subject after the lesson, which surely will be a benefit during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_40;It seems [From.GetBestName] would prefer to relax during the Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer not to give any lessons on the subject of stewardship for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_41;You are happy to hear that [From.GetBestName] is willing to teach you a lesson and leave the meeting certain that you will be able to use what [From.GetSheHe] taught you. Unfortunately, you quickly realize that [From.GetBestName]'s advice is very poor, which might be detrimental during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_42;As the celebration of the Lunar New Year gets underway one of your servants comes to you with a message from a [Root.Religion.GetName] shrine in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It seems the keepers of the shrine have heard of your celebration and are wishing you a most prosperous Year of the [Root.GetNewZodiac].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_42;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_LNY_43;[Root.GetSonDaughterCap] of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_43;You have seen many Lunar New Year celebrations since you were born during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] and though there have been years when the zodiac or the element has been the same as for the year of your birth the same combination only happens once every sixty years.\n\nAs the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is about to begin once more you receive word from several shrines in [Root.Capital.GetName] that they wish you a most prosperous new year and that they hope that you will live long enough to experience yet another full cycle of years. Several of your guests are quick to add their own well-wishes when they hear the news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_43;Most auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_LNY_44;[From.GetSonDaughterCap] of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_44;[From.GetBestName] was born many years ago during the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac], and that same alignment is once more taking place, which only happens every sixty years. It does not surprise you to hear that congratulations have been sent from some shrines in [From.Capital.GetName], along with wishes of prosperity for [From.GetBestName].\n\nSeveral of the guests at the Lunar New Year celebration are quick to add their own well-wishes to those from the shrine, and you decide that you should add your own to theirs as this is a special occasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_44;Wishing you prosperity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_46;It seems the musicians you hired to entertain the townspeople in [Root.Capital.GetName] during the Lunar New Year celebration were not as good as they claimed that they were. Their instruments are poorly tuned and the singers are frequently off-key or mess up their lyrics, with the result being highly unpleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_46;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_47;The musicians you hired for the Lunar New Year celebration have apparently performed above and beyond what could be expected of them as you are informed that the townspeople are speaking especially highly of you after the performance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_47;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_48;Though you arranged for some musicians to entertain the townspeople in [Root.Capital.GetName] before the Lunar New Year celebration started they have failed to show up. Upon further investigation it seems they have decided to take your money and leave your capital in haste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_48;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_49;The acrobats at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration are quite skilled at their job and you find yourself watching the show with with interest, which is replaced with disappointment whn you realize that the show is coming to an end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_49;Please stay a while longer!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_49;I've seen better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_50;It seems [From.GetBestName] really enjoyed watching the acrobats you hired for your Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] could be heard asking them to stick around a while longer when they were about to leave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_50;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_51;The acrobats you hired put on a good show for you and your guests and took their leave quickly once it was over. Shortly thereafter the captain of your guards came to you to inform you that someone had entered your quarters through the window and stolen some valuables. It does not take you long to realize that the acrobats probably did it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_51;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_52;As you head elsewhere after watching the acrobats at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration you find one of them approaching you. At first you fear an attack, but instead the man merely speaks.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], it has come to our attention that [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] has brought some poorly guarded valuables with [From.GetHerHim]. If you could distract [lny_burglar_target.GetHerHim] you will be richly rewarded.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_52;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_52;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_53;You return to your quarters after having watched the acrobats but barely have time to arrive before you are told that [From.GetBestName] wishes to see you. After speaking to [From.GetHerHim] regarding a trivial matter you venture back into your chambers only to realize that someone has broken into them and stolen some valuables.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_53;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_54;The man that approached you asking for you to distract [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] comes to find you later in the evening, a smile on his face.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], your distraction was most excellent! As promised, here is your share of the spoils." The man hands over some coins and then disappears into the night.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_54;A job well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_55;You are on your way back to your quarters when [From.GetBestName] comes running up to you asking to speak to you. It turns out that the discussion is about various trivialties and you start looking for an excuse to leave when one of the guards you brought with you comes running to inform you that someone attempted to enter your room but was chased off by the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_55;I wonder who sent them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_56;As you are conversing with [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] with the intention of keeping [lny_burglar_target.GetHerHim] away from [From.GetHerHis] quarters one of [From.GetHerHis] guards comes running and informs [From.GetHerHim] that some burglars were chased off. Apparently your distraction was insufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_56;At least they got away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_57;As you return to your quarters you hear the sound of someone falling in through the window. You quickly summon your guards and they manage to catch one of the acrobats from the Lunar New Year celebration before he can escape. The man is swiftly interrogated to reveal the identity of any co-conspirators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_57;He was working with [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_58;You are pondering how best to distract [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] when one of your servants comes to find you. Apparently the acrobats got impatient and one of their number entered [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName]'s quarters without waiting for the distraction. Even worse, the man got caught and divulged your name when questioned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_58;I had nothing to do with it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_59;Shortly after the acrobats are done with their performance at the Lunar New Year celebration you learn that some of them attempted to break into the quarters of [lny_burglar_target.GetBestName] but got caught once inside. Apparently the man divulged the name of [From.GetBestName] as a possible co-conspirator, though [From.GetSheHe] claims to be innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_59;I suspect it is true, but it is hard to tell...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_60;While it is a less important part of the Lunar New Year celebration than the dragon dance you had still benn looking forward to seeing a lion dance. However, when asking when the lion dancers might show up you are informed that there apparently won't be any at this particular Lunar New Year celebration in [From.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_60;I'll complain to [From.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_60;It is not that important...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_61;It turns out your choice not to hire some lion dance troupes was not entirely a popular one, as [From.GetBestName] comes up to you to voice [From.GetHerHis] displeasure over the fact that there won't be any at your Lunar New Year celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_61;You can't please everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_62;As is customary when there are lion dance troupes at a Lunar New Year celebration there is lettuce hung fifteen or more feet above the ground in various places in [From.Capital.GetName] for the lion dancers to try to reach. At one point during the celebrations you see two different lions aproaching the same lettuce. As they spot one another and make ready to fight you have the opportunity to bet on the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_62;I'll place a bet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_62;I'd rather not gamble...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_63;The two lion dance troupes square off in ritual combat over the lettuce under your watchful gaze. It is a close fight, and for a moment you think the lion you are betting on will be the loser, but then the battle quickly turns in its favour and the troupe in question is given the right to the lettuce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_63;I know a winner when I see them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_64;The two lion dance troupes square off in ritual combat over the lettuce under your watchful gaze. It is a close fight, and for a moment you think the lion you are betting on will be the winner, but then the battle quickly turns against it and it is forced to withdraw while the other lion gets the lettuce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_64;That was unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_65;It seems some of the lion dance troupes at the Lunar New Year celebration have decided to try something a bit different as they have erected several tall poles holding small circular platforms for them to perform on. However, as the performance is about to begin there are a few troupes that find themselves a person short.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_65;I can fill in for one person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_65;I'd rather watch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_66;You take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. Though it is not something you are accustomed to you find yourself getting the hang of what you are supposed to be doing easily enough, and towards the end your lion is declared the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_66;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_67;You take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. It is not something you are familiar with, and you struggle a bit before getting a hang of it. Though you later hear that your performance was adequate you find that another lion was declared the winner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_67;I suppose I shouldn't be surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_68;You take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. It is not something you are familiar with, and you struggle a bit before you think you have gotten the hang of it. However, it turns out you are mistaken and you are sent tumbling to the ground, injuring yourself in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_68;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_69;You take the place of one of the missing lion dancers and the performance begins. It is extremely unfamiliar, and you struggle valiantly to perform. One misstep is all it takes for you to fall off the platform you were standing on, dragging the other dancer with you and injuring yourself quite severely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_69;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_70;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to distribute a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. To your displeasure you discover that there is no money at all to be found in the envelope you were given.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_70;Nothing? Really?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_71;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to distribute a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. To your displeasure you discover that the sum of money in your envelope was miniscule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_71;That's all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_72;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to distribute a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. Your envelope does not contain a large amount of money, but at least it could have been worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_72;I suppose that was acceptable...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_73;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to distribute a red envelope to each guest at [From.GetHerHis] Lunar New Year celebration, containing an unknown amount of money. You discover that your envelope contains far more money than expected once you have opened it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_LNY_85;With some Lunar New Year celebrations coming under attack from a dragon in the past, it might be prudent to consider whether some more guards would be in order.

EVTDESC_LNY_98;"If it is strength you desire, [Root.GetBestName], then strength you shall have," the dragon replies after the request is made.

EVTDESC_LNY_100;"There are those that would not consider health to be a worthwhile boon," the dragon replies after the request is made.

EVTDESC_LNY_106;"Ah, wisdom," the dragon replies after the request is made. "It is a powerful boon indeed, and not something I would grant everyone. You, [Root.GetTitledName], are certainly worthy of it." You quickly feel new insights flooding into your mind as it finishes speaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_107;"Ah, wisdom," the dragon replies after the request is made. "It is a powerful boon indeed, and not something I would grant everyone. You, [From.GetTitledName], are certainly worthy of it." Given that [From.GetBestName] suddenly starts thanking the dragon profusely, it seems to have had some effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_108;"It is more common for someone to ask for physical strength than a sound mind, but a sound mind is indeed better at times," the dragon replies after the request is made.

EVTDESC_LNY_112;"You are unworthy of the boon you have requested, [Root.GetBestName]," the dragon replies after the request is made.

EVTDESC_LNY_138;You hear the sound of alarm bells ringing and fear an attack of some kind on the Lunar New Year celebration, but instead a silvery dragon with two large wings and a body that isn't particularly serpentine approaches the celebration and lands nearby in a very graceful manner.\n\n"I am Icava, the Champion of Justice," the dragon says, the voice feminine. "[From.GetBestName], with the evil dragon Fredak, the so-called 'Emperor of Embers', attacking those that would celebrate the Lunar New Year and our eastern cousins, I fear for the safety of those as virtuous as you." She reaches out and gently places a sword on the ground just in front of [From.GetBestName]. "I gift grant Gram. It should help with any draconic attacks on you and yours.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_138;A magnificient gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_139;The Lunar New Year celebration is disturbed by the arrival of a messenger who comes riding in from elsewhere in [Root.Capital.GetName].\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], there has been a dragon sighted in the distance!" the messenger proclaims.

EVTDESC_LNY_146;You are enjoying the Lunar New Year celebration when you suddenly hear a ferocious roar in the distance and the sound of alarm bells being ringing.

"I am Fredak, the Emperor of Embers.

EVTDESC_LNY_148;Word has reached you that a mighty red dragon calling itself Fredak, the Emperor of Embers has attacked the Lunar New Year celebration in [From.Capital.GetName]. It is still unknown where the beast came from, but its fury is not to be underestimated.\n\nAs it is unknown what caused the dragon to attack [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration, it is hard to say if the dragon might attack someone else in the future, and your lands could well be in danger until the beast is slain.\n\nShould you learn where its lair is, perhaps you could even consider gathering some companions to try to slay the beast, though it is likely to be a battle harder than any other you have experienced.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_LNY_192;The dragon dance in [Root.Capital.GetName] is rather pleasant to look at, but as you are watching it some of the dragon dancers suddenly draw weapons and run into the crowd, dragging several important townspeople into a building while shouting various contradictory demands that have to be met before the hostages are released. As you are wondering what to do one of your guards brings a young woman named [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName], who drops to her knees before speaking.\n\n"My [Root.GetLordLady], I know how to safely get your guards into that building to rescue the hostages," she says. "Please, put me in charge of the rescue mission, so that this situation might be resolved quickly and without anyone but the bandits getting harmed.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_192;I trust you to handle this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_192;Get away from me, silly girl!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_LNY_193;A Girl Worth Fighting Alongside?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_193;The dragon dance in [From.Capital.GetName] is rather pleasant to look at, but as you are watching it some of the dragon dancers suddenly draw weapons and run into the crowd, dragging several important townspeople into a building while shouting various contradictory demands that have to be met before the hostages are released.\n\nAs you are wondering how the situation will be handled [From.GetBestName] suddenly calls for volunteers to go on a rescue mission under the command of [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName], a young girl who apparently has managed to convince [From.GetBestName] that she is the right person to handle the hostage situation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_193;I'll help her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_193;Help a peasant girl? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_LNY_193;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_194;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] leads your guards and some volunteers from among your guests into the building the bandits took the hostages to through a passageway through the cellar from an adjacent building. She and the others come out through the main entrance with all of the hostages and with several captured bandits a short while later, with several people praising her for her quick thinking and how well she fought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_194;I knew she could do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_195;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] leads you, your fellow volunteers, and some guards into the building to which the hostages were taken through a secret passage leading into the cellar. You fight your way up floor by floor, with the young woman decisively leading you to victory, killing several of the bandits when they are foolish enough to stand in her way. By the time that you all leave the building you have nothing but praise for her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_195;With you on our side, victory is certain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_196;You wait with [From.GetBestName] and others that did not choose to go with [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] as she enters the building leading a small group of guards and volunteers. Sounds of fighting soom can be heard from the building the bandits entered, and before long [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] comes out through the main entrance with all the hostages accounted for and everyone who fought at her side praising her and her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_196;That worked?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_197;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] enters the building the bandits took the hostages to with some guards and volunteers. You hear fighting going on inside the building for a while and hope for good news, but soon [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] and some of the volunteers can be seen jumping out the windows to the relative safety outside. By the time that the guards get inside the hostages are all dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_197;She has failed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_198;[a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] enters the building the bandits took the hostages to with you and some others following her. You immediately encounter fierce resistance, with several guards dying before you clear the first room. The resistance does not let up, and soon you are all forced to jump out the nearest window to escape. You later learn that most of the bandits got away and that the hostages all died.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_198;It was her fault!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_199;You watch as [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] leads the guards and the volunteers inside the building the bandits entered with their hostages and wonder how well it will go. You soon have your answer as [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName] and various other people are forced to escape through the windows, and when the guards finally manage to get into the building they discover that all of the hostages are dead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_199;Hardly surprising!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_200;Though you feared that your guards might not be able to handle the bandits well enough to ensure that they all got killed or captured and also feared that they might not be able to save the hostages you are pleased to learn tht they are up to the task, and it seems [a_girl_worth_fighting_alongside.GetFullName]'s assistance was not something you needed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_200;The guards handled it well;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_201;Fireworks are an expected part of the Lunar New Year celebration, and [From.GetTitledName] has prepared a few that are fired off during the celebration. However, they are not particularly impressive, and even some of the townsfolk in [From.Capital.GetName] seem to have managed to outdo the display with ease, judging by the fireworks that go up elsewhere a short while later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_201;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_LNY_201;I'd rather not complain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_202;It seems [From.GetTitledName] did not enjoy the fireworks at your Lunar New Year celebration as [From.GetSheHe] can be heard complaining loudly. Even worse, your other guests soon start voicing their own complaints, suggesting that you have a poor grasp of what is right and proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_202;Perhaps I should have gotten more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_203;The fireworks at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s are not particularly impressive, and when [From.GetTitledName] decides to complain about it you see fit to follow suit. After all, even some of the townspeople in [FromFrom.Capital.GetName] seem to have managed to outdo [From.GetTitledName] with ease, judging by other fireworks nearby.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_203;Most inauspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_204;The fireworks you bought for your Lunar New Year celebration are perhaps not as impressive as they could have been if you had decided to invest some more money, but they are certainly more than adequate, and you find yourself enjoying watching them quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_204;That was rather nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_205;The fireworks at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration are perhaps not as impressive as they could have been if [From.GetSheHe] had decided to invest some more money, but they are certainly more than adequate, and you find yourself enjoying watching them quite a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_205;That was rather nice;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_206;As your Lunar New Year celebration nears its end the fireworks you bought are lit and the sky comes alight thanks to the multi-colored sparks released by the fireworks. The Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] is beginning in style.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_206;Auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTTITLE_LNY_208;The Grand Fireworks Display;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_208;The sky is lit by colorful explosions as the fireworks you bought for the Lunar New Year celebration are lit to celebrate the end of the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] and the start of the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac]. Some of the townsfolk are lighting their own fireworks, perhaps trying to compete with those being lit at your celebration, but they are insignificant next to yours.\n\nYou watch the show with a smile on your lips, satisfied with the knowledge that there should be no reason for anyone to complain about the fireworks due to the magnificience of the display. You hear several of your guests call out to you, praising your taste and wishing you prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_LNY_209;The sky is lit by colorful explosions as the fireworks at [From.GetBestName]'s Lunar New Year celebration are lit to celebrate the end of the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac] and the start of the Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac]. Some of the townsfolk are lighting their own fireworks, perhaps trying to compete with those being lit at at te main celebration, but they are barely worthy of the name.\n\nYou have heard of firework displays that could compete with the one you are witnessing in perhaps one or two other places, but you have never witnessed anything similar on your own and are thus uncertain if you can believe those tales. Even if they could, there is no denying [From.GetBestName]'s fireworks are magnificient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_LNY_209;Most auspicious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LNY_210;The Lunar New Year celebration has come to an end, and with it the Year of the [Root.GetOldElement] [Root.GetOldZodiac]. The Year of the [Root.GetNewElement] [Root.GetNewZodiac] has begun, and it is time to tend to other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
