Development Guildelines and Instructions

I am going to compile of things developers ought to follow to keep things consistent, neat, and have things working in general. This should be treated as a constitution of some sort in regards to coding.

- Always use the latest version for Developers
- Do not change vanilla files or the title de jure layout without the Director's permission
- Use correct parsing, ie follow the templates
- Make sure you follow the reserved sets for the character IDs -- [pending]
- If there are not enough then go to the stickied forum thread in regards to reserving IDs and request a set from the moderators, I will confirm for them to be added to the official list for this mod -- [pending]
- When reserving IDs for culture groups, they are to be done in blocks: minimum of ten for dynasties and a minimum of thirty for characters, both of them to be per culture with the latter to be in blocks of ten (there are no maximums) -- [pending]
- For character histories, make sure each characters are assigned to the appropriate culture (ethnic), if they affect vanilla then append the appropriate project intitials to the files, e.g. persian_soh.txt and mongol_kom.txt
- When adding historical characters, depending on the available sources (ie known rulers), you have three choices: 1. add them in the historical order (if you there a enough), 2. add them for the major bookmarks first (if there are too many), 3. add them for the vanilla bookmarks first then then The Old Gods then Charlemagne (if there are scarce) -- [pending]
- The lowest number should be reserved for the most important/interesting character (the above takes precedence however) -- [pending]
- Only one person should work per culture to prevent duplications thus clashes with IDs -- [pending]
- Only one person should work for the political geography in a given area -- [pending]
- Following the codes for cultures and religions is a must to prevent incompatibility between different developers
- When scripting decisions and/or events, make sure to write your name on top so you can gain proper credit (eg # Hansol "LumberKing" Lee), you are of course free to use an alias for the sake of anonymity and privacy
- Once done and you are uploading for amalgamation, try to only upload the files you have actually changed or made, of course do leave instructions in regards to which folders they belong in -- [pending]

Feel free to post feedback, this thread will be open to discussions and debates.
