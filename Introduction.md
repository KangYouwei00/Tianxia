Introduction

  First of all, I would like to welcome and congratulate everyone here as a developer for the most ambitious DLC-like modification for Secret Game II; "Tianxia: Confidential Expansion". I would like to thank .Me, who is the founder of predecessor mod "All Under Heaven", and Camara who is the founder of the merger mod "Umbra Spherae", for providing the base and everything they have worked thus far as well as taking the initiatives to allow us to continue the damn thing.

  So, what does it mean to be a developer for this mod? Well, it's like being a developer for any other mods; you're doing this as a hobby. Though we are all independent individuals (as we should be since we're not getting paid), it is expected that fellow developers follow the hierarchy of the group (ie Me, Myself, and I). Though this mod is divided into different Projects to spread the workload and the Project Lead will have a certain amount of autonomy, it is imperative that the direction from the Director is followed to have a consistent product in the end. To make certain that the Director (ie Me, Myself, and I) does not go out of control and destroy all future prospect of this mod, the two Founders (.Me and Camara) shall have Consular powers to not only give the Director sound advice, but to keep him in line.

  Now, with all the unpleasantries out of the way, the purpose here is to not only bring out an awesome result of our hobby where our fellow citizens of Paradox can enjoy this sheer awesomeness, but also to enjoy making this as well. There will be frustrations and conflicts along the way, but that is all part of the journey to attain glory for the Immortal- I mean, us, yeah... Um... Right.

 Both this Repository and the Main Thread will be used to guide how the Projects are to progress, but only this Repository will have certain kinds of informations as well as things for future Closed Testers.

 With that, I hope you enjoy your stay here and most importantly, enjoy making history!

 Kind Regards,

 Hansol "LumberKing" Lee
 Director of Secret Confidential Project
