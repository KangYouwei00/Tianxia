Missions, Objectives, and Plans

Here are the projects I have planned in my head which I would like to share with the developers. - Note: things are bound to change as we progress and as Paradox release new DLCs

Tianxia: Silk Road Expansion (flagship)
- Sons of Heaven (announced, flagship): The Far East as well as being a big mini-expansion to Rajas of India
- Khans of Mongolia (announced): An expansion to Horse Lords
- Sunrise Invasion (unannounced): An expansion to Sunset Invasion
- Genghis Khan (announced): An expansion to Khans of Mongolia and Horse Lords

Ifrikiya: The Saharan Extension (unannounced)
- Traders of Sahara (unannounced)
- Chieftains of Zanj (unannounced)

Columbia: New World Extension (unannounced, name pending)
- Warchiefs of America (unannounced)

Miscellaneous Extensions
- Sands of Time (unannounced, end project)
- Crusader Kings Universalis (unannounced, converter)

The flag ship Expansion and Project are the catalysts and the initator of this mod. The others are intended to expand on that or to throw some interesting things. The Extensions are really shits and giggles on my part, but has the potential to be serious projects. Unless already announced, I ask the developers to keep these ideas confidential and not let the public gain access to this information.

Regards,

Hansol "LumberKing" Lee
Director of Secret Confidential Project
