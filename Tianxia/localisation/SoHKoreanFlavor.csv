# Court Mu
EVTDESC_SOH_301;I have ordered my servants to look both near and far for a good candidate to be my new Court Mu, as I will need someone to manage various rituals at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_301;I hope they find someone quickly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_303;One of the servants I dispatched to look for a possible Court Mu has sent word that he has discovered a promising [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in a town some distance away. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a local healer of some renown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_303;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_303;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_304;Word has arrived from one of the servants I dispatched to search for a possible Court Mu that there is a travelling mystic in my realm that could be a good candidate, and based on what I have heard [possible_mu.GetSheHe] could indeed be the [possible_mu.GetManWoman] for the job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_304;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_304;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_305;I have received a message from one of my servants informing me that they have found a foreign-born [possible_mu.GetManWoman] who could be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is perhaps not quite what people would expect, but it would still be possible to hire [possible_mu.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_305;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_305;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_306;A [possible_mu.GetManWoman] has arrived at my court and has informed my servants that [possible_mu.GetSheHe] has heard that I am looking for a Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] claims to be a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] that would be well suited for that job, and I could probably do worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_306;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_306;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_307;A message has arrived from a nearby temple that they know of a theologian of some renown who could be convinced to serve as my Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetBestName] could indeed be the [possible_mu.GetManWoman] I am looking for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_307;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_307;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_308;One of my servants has sent a message that she has come across a scholar that very likely could be a good Court Mu for me. [possible_mu.GetBestName] is not known to me, but the servant that sent word has always been reliable in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_308;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_308;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_309;I have received word from one of my guards that there apparently is a young [possible_mu.GetManWoman] that recently was initiated as the Mu of a small village nearby. It is very likely [possible_mu.GetSheHe] would be willing to work as my Court Mu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_309;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_309;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_310;I have received word that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] near my capital that recently was initiated as a Mu but that remained possessed after the initiation ceremony. Though this is highly unusual, [possible_mu.GetSheHe] could potentially be a suitable Court Mu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_310;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_310;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_311;I have learned that one of my servants apparently would be a reasonable Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetBestName] could indeed be a decent candidate, even though [possible_mu.GetSheHe] is known to be a bit... odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_311;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_311;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_312;One of my agents has sent word that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in a distant part of my realm that possibly could be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHe] supposedly is a very strong believer, and well versed in Muist rituals and teachings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_312;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_312;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_313;I have been told that one of my agents discovered a potential Court Mu by pure accident when he was having a drink at a local tavern and came across a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] that seemed like a rather good candidate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_313;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_313;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_314;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and not entirely unfamiliar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_314;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_314;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_315;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and decently familiar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_315;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_315;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_316;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and quite familiar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_316;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_316;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_317;I have learned that there is a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] in my realm that potentially would be a good Court Mu. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] is apparently a [possible_mu.GetManWoman] of learning, and exceptionally familiar with Muist rituals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_317;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_317;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_318;One of the agents I sent to find me a Court Mu has sent word that she has discovered a possible candidate. The [possible_mu.GetManWoman] is not particularly remarkable, but that is not necessarily a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_318;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_318;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_319;It seems one of my relatives, [possible_mu.GetBestName], would be a potential Court Mu, or at least that is what I have been told. [possible_mu.GetSheHeCap] seems quite willing to take the job, too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_319;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_319;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_320;I have received word that one of my vassals, [possible_mu.GetBestName], seems to be a fairly good choice as my Court Mu, and [possible_mu.GetSheHe] is not an entirely disagreeable choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_320;A perfect candidate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_320;I think I'll keep looking...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Gut
EVTDESC_SOH_321;I have received a request from [From.GetBestName] to perform a Gut ritual for [From.GetHerHim], and as [From.GetHerHis] Court Mu I am expected to do that when it is requested. Some money has been set aside for the ritual, according to what I have been told.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_321;I will begin my preparations at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_321;I should ask for more money...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_322;My Court Mu, [From.GetBestName], has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] would prefer to have more money made available for the Gut as there are quite a few things that need to be arranged for the ritual.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_322;You shall have more money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_322;I think I've given you enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_323;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to grant me extra funds for the Gut ritual I am to perform. I should spend this money on the ritual as I said, but perhaps there are other ways I could use it that are more appealing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_323;I will make all possible preparations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_323;This calls for a drink! Or ten!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_323;I think I'll keep this for now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_323;Time to make a run for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_324;Apparently my Court Mu had other plans for the money I gave [From.GetHerHim] than extensive preparations for the Gut ritual, seeing as [From.GetSheHe] was found passed out in a local tavern this morning after having spent quite a bit of the money on drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_324;Perhaps I need a new Court Mu...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_325;It seems I had a few too many drinks last night as I woke up to the sound of  one of [From.GetBestName]'s guard yelling at me and discovered that I apparently had passed out in a local tavern and only was discovered well after the Gut was supposed to begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_325;Maybe this was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_326;[From.GetBestName], my Court Mu, could not be found when the ritual was supposed to begin, and when my servants started asking around they learned that [From.GetSheHe] apparently had been seen riding off into the distance. It seems [From.GetSheHe] decided to take my money and run.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_326;I want this thief caught!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_327;[From.GetBestName] has informed me that no more funds will be made available for the Gut ritual, stating that what was set aside initially should be more than sufficient.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_327;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_329;It is almost time for the Gut to begin, and I need to decide whether I think a Dodang-gut, asking for well-being and prosperity, or a Ssitgim-gut, placating the spirits of the deceased, is what I am aiming for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_329;A Dodang-gut sounds right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_329;A Ssitgim-gut would be appropriate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_330;It is almost time for the Gut to begin, and my Court Mu, [From.GetBestName], has informed me that it will be a Dodang-gut, hopefully resulting in well-being and prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_330;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_331;It is almost time for the gut to begin, and my Court mu, [From.GetBestName], has informed me that it will be a Ssitgim-gut, hopefully resulting in the spirits of the dead being placated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_331;I look forward to it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_334;As the Gut begins [FromFrom.GetBestName] makes sure to purify the altar with fire and water, before burning white paper to ensure purification of the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_334;Of course [FromFrom.GetSheHe] wouldn't forget that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_335;I begin the Gut in accordance with custom, purifying the altar with fire and water, and then burn white paper to ensure purification of the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_335;Surely nobody would forget to do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_336;As the Gut begins [FromFrom.GetBestName] does not purify the altar with fire and water as one would expect, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] also does not burn white paper to ensure purification of the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_336;How could [FromFrom.GetSheHe] forget that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_337;I begin the Gut and welcome everyone present, quickly moving through the steps of the ritual. It is only after I have gone through several things that I realize that I forgot the initial purification of the altar and the body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_337;I really should have remembered that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_340;As the Gut continues [FromFrom.GetBestName] starts reciting a myth concerning the deities that are about to be invoked. It is a rather familiar myth, and naturally my Court Mu does a flawless job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_340;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_341;I continue with the Gut and take some time to recite a myth about the deities I am about to invoke. It is a myth that most people are familiar with, and judging by the faces of those that are listening to me I do a very good job reciting it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_341;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_342;[FromFrom.GetBestName] starts reciting a familiar myth about the deities to be invoked at the Gut, but before long the things [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is saying start sounding very wrong, and the mistakes [FromFrom.GetSheHe] make are more than just a few.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_342;Doesn't [FromFrom.GetSheHe] know this myth?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_343;I continue with the Gut and start reciting a myth about some of the deities I mean to invoke. However, I quickly find that I do not remember it as well as I thought I did, and judging by the faces of those around me they have noticed the mistakes I have made reciting the myth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_343;Well, that didn't go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_346;The Gut continues, and [FromFrom.GetBestName] is really not doing things the way anyone would have expected. Many Mu have their own style, so it is reasonable for there to be some deviation, but this really is far too different from what would be proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_346;What was all that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_347;I continue with the Gut, but as it continues I find myself forgetting just what it is I am supposed to do. I thought I had prepared well enough to pull this charade off, but I am really starting to have second thoughts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_347;That did not go well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_348;My Court Mu, [FromFrom.GetBestName], continues with the Gut, carrying out ritual after ritual in a fashion that I doubt that even the most zealous of zealots could find any fault with. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] really is a remarkable [FromFrom.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_348;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_349;I continue with the Gut, mindful of all the things I have read up on about the rituals I am performing. At first, I wonder if the audience will suspect that I am not a proper Mu, but none of them seem to think that anything is amiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_349;My preparations paid off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_350;The Gut continues, and though [FromFrom.GetBestName] seems to know the required rituals quite well what [FromFrom.GetSheHe] does and says is borderline offensive to me and some of my guests. I know my Court Mu is common-born, but this really is beyond what I would expect even from a commoner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_350;Perhaps I should find a less rude Court Mu?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_351;I continue with the Gut and carry out the appropriate rituals, making sure to pay attention to the audience as a whole and not just [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] friends. However, judging by the facial expressions of the more prominent members of the audience, this might be coming across as rude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_351;I might have made a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_352;I know very well that my Court Mu is a foreigner and that customs might be rather different elsewhere, but some of the things [FromFrom.GetBestName] is doing during the Gut are quite a bit stranger than I had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_352;How curious...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_352;This is not proper!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_353;I carry out the Gut in accordance with the customs of my people, which seems to surprise many of those in attendance as local rituals apparently are quite a bit different. Some of them even look a bit offended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_353;I assure you this is correct!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_354;Some of the commoners in attendance at the Gut being performed by [FromFrom.GetBestName] are in need of medical assistance, and my Court Mu makes it known that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] will help them to the best of [FromFrom.GetHerHis] ability as soon as the Gut is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_354;How kind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_355;I am quite aware that some of the people in attendance at the Gut are in need of medical assistance, and I make sure to let them know that I will help them to the best of my ability as soon as it is over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_355;I am always willing to help the sick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_356;As the Gut continues my Court Mu gets a strange expression on [FromFrom.GetHerHis] face and then starts speaking in a completely different voice. It is not uncommon for spirits to possess a Mu during a Gut, but the things [FromFrom.GetBestName] says are quite unusual, and I do not seem to be the only one thinking that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_356;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_357;As the Gut continues I feel a presence in my head that I have never felt before. Words come pouring in, some of them beautiful, some of them terrible, and I know that I know the truth, and that the truth must be set free.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_357;THESE WORDS MUST BE SPOKEN!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_358;[FromFrom.GetBestName] calls out for the spirits and any deities nearby to give [FromFrom.GetHerHim] their blessing and to look kindly on the Gut and those that are there. I can almost feel something answer [FromFrom.GetHerHis] call.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_358;I am glad I hired [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_359;I continue with the Gut, going through several rituals carefully, and then reach out, calling for any spirits or deities that might be nearby to bless me and the others at the Gut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_359;Join us! Bless us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_360;I have known that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is quite learned for a long time, but until today I do not know I if really had a good sense of just how learned [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is. The Gut is quite exceptional, and is going extremely well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_360;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is truly a good Mu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_361;I continue with the Gut and put all the various knowledge I have acquired in the past to good use. Judging by the expressions I can see on the faces of those in the audience, I must be doing a very good job.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_361;I think this went very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_362;My Court Mu, [FromFrom.GetBestName], takes some time during the Gut to give a speech about the Muist faith and how everyone must do everything in their power to ensure that it triumphs over all other faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_362;Our faith is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_363;My Court Mu, [FromFrom.GetBestName], takes some time during the Gut to give a speech about the Muist faith and how everyone must do everything in their power to ensure that it triumphs over all other faiths.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_363;I suppose [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_363;I think this is rather improper...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_364;As the Gut continues I take some time to give a short speech to the crowd, telling all present that the Muist faith must triumph over all other faiths and how every Muist must work towards this goal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_364;Our faith is the only true faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_367;My court Mu continues with the Dodang-gut, and though I am unsure whether there actually are any spirits around to bring prosperity and well-being the commoners in the audience seem impressed. If they are impressed they will surely work much harder, which should bring prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_367;I suppose that works...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_368;I continue with the Dodang-gut, and though it is possible that not everyone in the audience is convinced that the spirits will bring prosperity and well-being it seems many of the commoners are quire impressed, and I suspect that they will work harder as a result, which likely will bring prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_368;And the spirits will also help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_369;The Dodang-gut continues, and [FromFrom.GetBestName] calls for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. I am unsure if anyone actually feels the spirits are listening, but at the very least the commoners seem thankful a Gut is being held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_369;I suppose that's good enough...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_370;I continue with the Dodang-gut and call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. Nobody in the audience seems particularly convinced that the spirits are listening, but at least they do not seem to be unhappy with the Gut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_370;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_371;As my Court Mu continues with the Dodang-gut and call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being I can feel something stirring in the air. It seems the spirits truly are listening to my Court Mu, and that my lands truly will be blessed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_371;This was a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_372;I call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being as I continue with the Dodang-gut, and I can feel the air stir as the answer my call. [From.GetBestName] will doubtlessly be very pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_372;Thank you, spirits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_373;[FromFrom.GetBestName] continues with the Dodang-gut, calling for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. Many in the audience look rather skeptical of the whole thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_373;Well, that's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_374;I continue with the Dodang-gut and call for the spirits to bring prosperity and well-being. Despite carrying out various rituals properly, a large part of the audience seems rather skeptical of the whole thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_374;Well, that's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_375;Though I believe that [FromFrom.GetBestName] carries out the Dodang-gut quite well the commoners in the audience seem quite displeased by the whole thing, with several of them crying out in anger as the Gut continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_375;This could be bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_376;I continue with the Dodang-gut and carry out the rituals quite properly, but something seems to have upset the audience even so as many of the commoners become agitated and cry out that I am a poor Mu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_376;This is not going as expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_378;As the Ssitgim-gut continues I need to figure out just what I am going to say that the spirits of the deceased supposedly are thinking about [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_378;I'll claim they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_378;I'll claim they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_378;I'll claim they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_378;I will claim someone feels angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_378;I will claim someone feels forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_379;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that they probably are happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_379;They are probably happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_379;I'll claim they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_379;I'll claim they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_380;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that they probably are indifferent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_380;I'll claim they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_380;They are probably indifferent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_380;I'll claim they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_381;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that they probably are upset.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_381;I'll claim they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_381;I'll claim they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_381;They are probably upset...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_382;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that someone might be angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_382;Someone is probably angry...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_382;I'll claim someone is feeling forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_383;I am having trouble determining just how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and the Ssitgim-gut has reached the point where I need to say something about how they feel. My best guess is that someone might feel forgiving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_383;I'll claim someone is angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_383;Someone is probably feeling forgiving...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_384;As the Ssitgim-gut continues I suddenly get a sense of just how the spirits must feel about [From.GetBestName] and [From.GetHerHis] conduct. There is no mistake whatsoever, and I must say what I have been told.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_384;They must be happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_384;They must be indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_384;They must be upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_384;They must be feeling angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_SOH_384;They must be feeling forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_385;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_385;I know they are happy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_386;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_386;I know they are indifferent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_387;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_387;I know they are upset!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_388;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_388;I know someone is feeling angry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_389;I have reached the point of the Ssitgim-gut where I need to reveal how the spirits feel about [From.GetBestName], and just as I am about to speak I get a good sense of what I have to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_389;I know someone is feeling forgiving!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_390;As the Ssitgim-gut continues [From.GetBestName] makes it known that the spirits are most pleased with me and my conduct, and that they look favorably on the Ssitgim-gut as a whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_390;This pleases me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_390;I rather doubt they are happy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_391;I inform [From.GetBestName] that the spirits are happy with [From.GetHerHim], and [From.GetSheHe] seems quite pleased to hear about this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_391;Good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_392;I inform [From.GetBestName] that the spirits are happy with [From.GetHerHim], but [From.GetSheHe] does not seem to believe my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_392;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_393;[From.GetBestName] tells everyone at the Ssitgim-gut that the spirits are mostly indifferent towards me and my conduct, and that they do not care one way or another about the Ssitgim-gut.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_393;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_393;This can't be right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_394;I tell [From.GetBestName] and everyone else at the Ssitgim-gut that the spirits are mostly indifferent, and while [From.GetSheHe] does not seem displeased [From.GetSheHe] also does not look happy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_394;I suppose that's to be expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_395;I tell [From.GetBestName] and everyone else at the Ssitgim-gut that the spirits are mostly indifferent, but it seems as if my words are not believed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_395;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_396;My Court Mu, [From.GetBestName], informs me that the spirits are quite unhappy, and that the Ssitgim-gut barely has been sufficient to placate them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_396;That's bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_396;I don't believe it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_397;I tell [From.GetBestName] that the spirits barely have been placated by the Ssitgim-gut since they were quite unhappy to begin with, and [From.GetSheHe] does not look happy even if [From.GetSheHe] does not contradict me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_397;I think that went well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_398;I tell [From.GetBestName] that the spirits barely have been placated by the Ssitgim-gut since they were quite unhappy to begin with, but [From.GetSheHe] does not look as if [From.GetSheHe] believes a word of what I am saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_398;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_399;My Court Mu speaks of how one of the spirits that have been present during the Ssitgim-gut is very angry with someone present, someone that has killed kin. I am fairly certain [From.GetBestName] is speaking about me, as I am known to be a kinslayer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_399;I will become a better person!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_399;You had it coming!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_400;I let everyone at the Ssitgim-gut know that one of the spirits present is very angry with a kinslayer, and [From.GetBestName] seems as if [From.GetSheHe] regrets [From.GetHerHis] past actions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_400;I suppose that's good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_401;I let everyone at the Ssitgim-gut know that one of the spirits present is very angry with a kinslayer. As I finish speaking [From.GetBestName] calls out that there are some that deserve to die even if they are kin, and that the spirit really had it coming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_401;Well, that's unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_402;[From.GetBestName] tells everyone at the Ssitgim-gut that there is a spirit present that was killed by close kin but that has come to forgive the kinslayer. I am quite convinced that I am the kinslayer that has been forgiven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_402;I am glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_403;I inform everyone at the Ssitgim-gut about one of the spirits being willing to forgive a kinslayer that is present, and [From.GetBestName] really seems relieved to hear my words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_403;Hardly a surprise...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_405;The Gut has come to an end, and regardless of whether everything went well or not it is time to do other things. I rather expect there to be work that requires my attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_405;I should consider another Gut in the future...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_406;I finish up the Gut and the people in the audience start to depart. Regardless of how I feel things went, it is time to do other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_406;That's all for now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Bulguksa
EVTDESC_SOH_501;The time has come to leave on my pilgrimage. The journey will not be short, but based on what I have been told both Bulguksa and Seokguram are impressive enough that I will find the journey to have been worth it when I arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SOH_502;At the Foot of the Mountain;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_502;I have arrived at the foot of the mountain known as Dongak, the East Big Mountain. On its slopes, Bulguksa Temple and the Seokguram Grotto can be found, both of them holy places without compare in the Korean Peninsula.\n\nI am certainly not the only pilgrim here, and I am certainly not alone in feeling awed by the sight of the mountain and the temple above me. Within its walls, I can doubtlessly find monks and scholars and other notable people from both near and far, and I can probably find some in the grotto too.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_502;Time to visit the holy places...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_504;One of the many sights to be seen at Bulguksa is Yeonhwagyo, the Lotus Flower Bridge, and the steps leading up to it. Many delicate lotus carvings can be found on those steps, faded due to the many pilgrims that have ascended the steps in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_504;Faded or not, they are quite beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_505;As I walk up the stairway leading to Cheongungyo, the Blue Cloud Bridge, and Baegungyo, the White Cloud Bridge, I find myself considering my path to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_505;Enlightenment shall be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_505;Enlightenment can wait...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_506;One of the many sights at Bulguksa is Dabotap, the Pagoda of Many Treasures. Inside it, I can see a number of valuable and beautiful relics of great importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_506;Those relics sure are impressive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_507;Seokgatap, the Shadowless Pagoda, can be found at Bulguksa. Legend says that the wife of Asadal, the man who built the pagoda, drowned herself nearby after overhearing rumors indicating that her husband was going to marry a princess of Silla.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_507;Rumours always do more harm than good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_508;As I step up to Seokgatap, the Shadowless Pagoda, and take a closer look, I discover that one of the walls seems to be hollow. Investigating it, I find several valuable relics that apparently were unknown even to the monks at the temple, and they give one of them to me as a reward for my discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_508;I thank you for this gift!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_509;Two pagodas, Seokgatap and Dabotap, can be found near one another at Bulguksa. The former is rather plain, while the other is quite ornate. One of the other pilgrims asks me which one I prefer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_509;Seokgatap is quite beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_509;Dabotap is clearly superior!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_510;There are many Buddha statues at Bulguksa and Seokguram, and they are all quite impressive. One of them is a gilt-bronze statue of the Amitabha Buddha, which is rather abstract but still beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_510;I am glad to have seen it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_511;Bulguksa was partially constructed to pacify the spirits of Gim Daeseong's parents, and as I am spending time at the temple I find myself considering my own deceased parents and what they might think of me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_511;I must avoid disappointing them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_512;A massive Buddha sitting on a lotus pedestal can be found in Seokguram, surrounded by other statues. It seemingly has a halo around it, created by the decorations found nearby, and is one of the most impressive statues I have ever come across.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_512;But which Buddha is it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_513;Along with depictions of various Buddhas, bodhisattvas, disciples, and the Four Heavenly Kings found in Seokguram there are also two statues of Hindu gods, which is a bit unexpected as the grotto is a Buddhist place of worship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_513;I have always been intrigued by Hinduism...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_513;They are beautiful in their own way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_513;Their presence is unwelcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_514;The Four Heavenly Kings guard the Seokguram Grotto. I have always found them quite intriguing, and should perhaps try to emulate one of them. The question is, which one?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_514;Damun-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_514;Jeungjang-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_514;Jiguk-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_514;Gwangmok-cheonwang, of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_lifestyle_to_mystic;You will become a Mystic, forsaking any old lifestyle in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_lifestyle_to_scholar;You will become a Scholar, forsaking any old lifestyle in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
change_lifestyle_to_theologian;You will become a Theologian, forsaking any old lifestyle in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_515;During my visit to Bulguksa I find myself talking to several of the other pilgrims. One of them turns out to be a mystic of some renown, and tells me about the lifestyle he has chosen to follow in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_515;Teach me how to be a Mystic!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_515;Intriguing, but not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_516;During my visit to Bulguksa I find myself talking to several of the other pilgrims. One of them turns out to be a scholar of some renown, and tells me about the lifestyle he has chosen to follow in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_516;Teach me how to be a Scholar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_516;Intriguing, but not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_517;During my visit to Bulguksa I find myself talking to several of the other pilgrims. One of them turns out to be a theologian of some renown, and tells me about the lifestyle he has chosen to follow in great detail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_517;Teach me how to be a Theologian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_517;Intriguing, but not for me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_518;I had expected to meet men and women aspiring to reach Nirvana at Bulguksa, but instead I have met sinners and people of little faith, and I feel my own faith being tested more and more as time progresses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_518;Maybe this was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_519;There are many monks to be found at Bulguksa, and they are a very welcoming lot, willing to answer any questions asked by pilgrims like me and eager to help everyone on the path to enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_519;They serve the Buddha well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_520;As I am about to leave Bulguksa after enjoying the sights one of the monks there approaches me to ask if I would be willing to make a charitable donation, maybe suspecting that I might be someone with more money than most that come to the temple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_520;Of course I will donate to charity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_520;I have no money to spare...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# Chuseok

celebrate_chuseok;Hold Chuseok;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
celebrate_chuseok_desc;Hold a Chuseok celebration, inviting your vassals and courtiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_601;Preparations have begun for the Chuseok. Doubtlessly my servants have most things under control, but there will likely be things that I have to get involved in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_601;I'll offer input when necessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_602;It is customary for the commoners to tend local tombs - specifically those of your own ancestors - prior to the Chuseok. I am not expected to take part, as I have matters of state to attend to, but it would doubtlessly be appreciated if I helped out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_602;I will give this my full attention!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_602;I can spare a few moments...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_602;I can spare a few servants...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_602;This would be a waste of my time and resources!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_603;Prior to the Chuseok, it is customary to make offerings to the ancestors. I could choose not to do this, since the needs of the realm sometimes need to come first, but it would doubtlessly be taken poorlby by some people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_603;I will make a grand offering!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_603;I will make a small offering...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_603;This would be a waste of my money!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_604;One of the traditions associated with the Chuseok is the serving of songpyeon, half-moon-shaped rice cakes. My guests would definitely expect me to have some of them ready, but how much can I afford to spend on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_604;I will spare no expense!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_604;I will make sure everyone gets at least one...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_604;Songpyeon are overrated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_605;Though not considered as important as songpyeon, it is not rare for there to be hangwa - traditional Korean confections - served at the Chuseok. Maybe it would be worth spending some money on hangwa?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_605;I definitely want a lot of hangwa!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_605;A little wouldn't be amiss...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_605;I don't think hangwa is a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_606;In addtion to various foods, my guests will likely want drinks such as makgeolli at the Chuseok. However, there is a risk that the feast could get rowdy if people drink too much, so maybe it isn't such a great idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_606;Rowdy guests or not, I want a lot of drinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_606;A moderate amount would be prudent...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_606;Let's not invest in drinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_607;In addition to traditional food such as songpyeon, your guests will of course require some meals during the Chuseok. How much do you want to spend on regular food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_608;With the preparations for the Chuseok all but done, it is time to send out invitations to ensure that the guests know to arrive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_609;[Root.GetBestName],\nI am holding a Chuseok and hope that you and your relatives will be able to attend.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_609;I'll be there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_609;I have made other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_610;[Root.GetBestName],\nI have made other plans and will not be coming to your Chuseok.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_611;Shortly after my servants finished the preparations for the Chuseok my guests started arriving from near and far. It is time to be a good host and to celebrate the harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_611;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_612;[From.GetBestName] courteously greets me and my companions as we arrive at [From.GetHerHis] Chuseok, telling me that [From.GetSheHe] is glad I could make it and that [From.GetSheHe] hopes that the journey was pleasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_612;I hope this will be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_614;The food at [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok is certainly plentiful. It seems [From.GetSheHe] has spared no expense when it comes to ensuring that [From.GetHerHis] guests both will have enough to eat and that they will find something they personally like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_614;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_614;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_614;Say nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_615;The food at [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok is perhaps less generous than you would have expected it to be, but there is probably enough of it to ensure that none of the guests will go hungry even if not everyone will get what they prefer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_615;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_615;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_615;Say nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_616;Though there probably is enough food at [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok to ensure that most of the guests will be satisfied, the food is not particularly impressive, and the quantity certainly is not what you think everyone had expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_616;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_616;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_616;Say nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_617;It seems [From.GetBestName] approved of the quantity and quality of the food being provided for various meals at the Chuseok, as [From.GetSheHe] made sure to compliment both me and the cooks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_617;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_618;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not approve of the quantity or quality of the food being provided for various meals at the Chuseok, as [From.GetSheHe] made sure to complain to both me and the cooks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_618;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_619;No Chuseok would be complete without a juldarigi contest, and my Chuseok does of course feature one. However, before the final preparations for it can be made I need to decide whether to rig the contest - as often happens - so that the feminine side wins and the harvest is bountiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_619;Let's rig it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_619;We will not rig the contest!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_620;As you and the other guests are taking position near the huge rice-straw ropes to be used in the juldarigi contest at [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok it becomes clear that the [Root.GetMaleFemale] side has too many people, and you are asked to join the other team despite clearly being a [Root.GetManWoman].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_620;I don't mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_620;This is not what I wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_621;As it is best for the two teams taking part in the juldarigi to be balanced it is sometimes necessary for people to not be on their preferred team. However, [From.GetBestName] did not take being asked to join the other team well, and is making a huge scene.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_621;Of course [From.GetSheHe] would complain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_622;The way the two ropes used for the juldarigi connect to one another is somewhat suggestive, and several of the contestants make comments filled with innuendo. Maybe I should join in, to show that I am not prudish?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_622;I'll stay out of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_622;I'll join in!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_623;The way the two ropes used for the juldarigi connect to one another is somewhat suggestive, and several of the contestants make comments filled with innuendo, with [From.GetBestName] in particular making no secret of what [From.GetSheHe] thinks it looks like.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_623;That was very crude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_623;[From.GetSheHeCap] sure knows what to say!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_625;With the teams in place, the juldarigi can begin. On my signal, the teams give a great cheer and begin. It takes just one pull to decide the contest, with the western - female - team winning, which means a bountiful harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_625;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_626;With the teams in place, the juldarigi can begin. On [From.GetBestName]'s signal, the teams give a great cheer and begin. It takes just one pull to decide the contest, with the western - female - team winning, which means a bountiful harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_626;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_627;With the teams in place, the juldarigi can begin. On my signal, the teams give a great cheer and begin. It takes just one pull to decide the contest, with the eastern - male - team winning, which does not bove well for the harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_627;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_628;With the teams in place, the juldarigi can begin. On [From.GetBestName]'s signal, the teams give a great cheer and begin. It takes just one pull to decide the contest, with the eastern - male - team winning, which does not bove well for the harvest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_628;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_629;As the juldarigi ends and people start heading back inside I can't help but remember the lewd comments made by [FromFrom.GetBestName]. Perhaps [FromFrom.GetSheHe] made them to indicate that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] is looking for some more intimate entertainment? If so, maybe I should approach [FromFrom.GetHerHim]?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_629;It's worth a try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_629;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_630;It seems [From.GetBestName] paid particular attention to the lewd comments I made as the juldarigi was about to begin, as [From.GetSheHe] has approached me to suggest that perhaps the two of us should find someplace private to engage in activities inspired by those comments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_630;Oh, I'd like that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_630;You and me? Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_631;[From.GetBestName] did not appreciate my suggestion and told me to get away from [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] was hoping that someone else would approach [From.GetHerHim], or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] never meant for anything to happen at all...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_631;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_632;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to my suggestion, and it was not terribly difficult for us to find somewhere private to get to know one another far more intimarely than we previously did. Some time later, [From.GetSheHe] asks me if I think we should do it again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_632;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_632;This was just a one-time thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_633;It did not take me and [From.GetBestName] long to find somewhere private to get to know one another quite a bit more intimately, and when we parted ways [From.GetSheHe] made it clear that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to another similar opportunity in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_633;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_634;It did not take me and [From.GetBestName] long to find somewhere private to get to know one another quite a bit more intimately. However, when we finally parted ways [From.GetSheHe] made it clear that however fun it was it would not become a regular thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_634;That might be for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_635;During [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok I have been spending quite a bit of time in the company of [chuseok_friend.GetBestName], a very fascinating [chuseok_friend.GetManWoman]. [chuseok_friend.GetSheHeCap] seems to have appreciated my company too, so maybe we can become friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_635;I'm sure we can be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_635;I have enough friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_636;I have been enjoying my time at [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s Chuseok quite a bit, and many of the guests have been quite fascinating. One of them, [From.GetBestName], seems to have appreciated my company quite a bit, as [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that maybe this is the beginning of a new friendship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_636;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_636;I have enough friends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_637;[From.GetBestName] seems to be as appreciative of my company as I am of [From.GetHerHis], and [From.GetSheHe] was quite open to the idea of becoming friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_637;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_638;Though [From.GetBestName] remained courteous when we spoke it quickly became clear that [From.GetSheHe] is not particularly interested in the idea of becoming friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_638;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_639;Though several of the guests at [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok have been quite courteous, [chuseok_rival.GetBestName] is anything but, and [chuseok_rival.GetSheHe] has said some things to me that I am not sure if I should take personally or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_639;This is unforgiveable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_639;I'm sure it was a misunderstanding...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_640;Though most of the guests at the Chuseok have been pleasant to interact with, [From.GetBestName] has not been one such individual. [From.GetSheHeCap] has been critical of everything I have said, and has gone as far as to claim that I am now [From.GetHerHis] mortal enemy due to my supposed insults.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_640;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_641;As the harvest and the Chuseok celebration are closely linked it is unsurprising that some of the people taking part in the celebrations are discussing the former. Maybe I should see what I can learn, and see if I can share my knowledge about the matter?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_641;I will take part in this discussion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_641;I should stay out of it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_642;The discussion about how to get the most out of the harvest goes well, and though my ideas perhaps are not as imaginative as some ideas brought forward by others I still manage to impress several people with my insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_642;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_643;The discussion about the harvest touches upon several other matters of governance, and thanks to some comments made by the others taking part in the discussion I find myself getting a better understanding of matters of governance as as a result, as I now see several things that should have been obvious before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_643;That was productive!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_644;Though some of the guests not taking part in the harvest discussion express surprise about the fact that I and the others are willing to discuss such matters during the Chuseok I find myself more and more convinced that it was a good idea, and that I should not let myself get distracted from work by a mere celebration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_644;Hard work pays off!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_645;I am unsure whether I really learned anything from the discussion I had regarding the harvest, though at least I am fairly certain I did not make a complete fool of myself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_645;Well, it could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_646;I thought that I would be able to impress people with my knowledge by joining the harvest discussion, but it seems I overestimated either my knowledge or my ability to convey it as the people I talked to seem thoroughly unimpressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_646;That's bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_647;I join the others discussing the harvest, ready to present my ideas regarding how it might be improved. Sadly, it seems the others are unconvinced enough by how I introduce my topic that they dismiss my point entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_647;You all refuse to listen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_648;I eagerly join the conversation about the harvest, talking to all the participants quite a bit, but it seems my approach to the conversation is not to everyone's liking as it ends fairly quickly without me having learned anything useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_648;Maybe I talked too much...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_649;The Chuseok celebration is of course closely tied to the Korean Peninsula, which has been an area where several religions have had a significant presence. During the celebration, I have considered the merits of the Muist faith and whether it is superior to the [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_649;I will become a Muist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_649;I will become a secret Muist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_649;I will not abandon my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_650;The Chuseok celebration is of course closely tied to the Korean Peninsula, which has been an area where several religions have had a significant presence. During the celebration, I have considered the merits of the Reformed Muist faith and whether it is superior to the [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_650;I will become a Reformed Muist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_650;I will become a secret Reformed Muist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_650;I will not abandon my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_651;The Chuseok celebration is of course closely tied to the Korean Peninsula, which has been an area where several religions have had a significant presence. During the celebration, I have considered the merits of the Buddhist faith and whether it is superior to the [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_651;I will become a Buddhist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_651;I will become a secret Buddhist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_651;I will not abandon my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_652;The Chuseok celebration is of course closely tied to the Korean Peninsula, which has been an area where several religions have had a significant presence. During the celebration, I have considered the merits of the Confucian faith and whether it is superior to the [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_652;I will become a Confucian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_652;I will become a secret Confucian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_652;I will not abandon my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_653;The Chuseok celebration is of course closely tied to the Korean Peninsula, which has been an area where several religions have had a significant presence. During the celebration, I have considered the merits of the Taoist faith and whether it is superior to the [Root.Religion.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_653;I will become a Taoist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_653;I will become a secret Taoist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_653;I will not abandon my faith!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_655;My decision to make sure that there would be planty of songpyeon at the Chuseok seems to have been to everyone's liking. It was perhaps a bit expensive, but the guests are most definitely appreciative.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_655;I made the right decision!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_656;[From.GetBestName] clearly understands just how important it is to serve songpyeon at the Chuseok, as [From.GetSheHe] clearly has spent quite a bit of money to ensure that there would be more than enough for each of [From.GetHerHis] guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_656;I certainly approve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_657;My decision to not invest heavily in songpyeon seems to have been a reasonable one. Doubtlessly, there are a few guests that would have preferred more, but as best I can tell everyone is reasonably pleased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_657;Nobody seems unhappy, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_658;My decision not to serve songpyeon at the Chuseok does not seem to have been appreciated at all. I saved some money, but several of my guests have complained loudly since they learned that there would be no songpyeon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_658;I made the wrong decision...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_659;[From.GetBestName] does not seem to understand that songpyeon are an important part of the Chuseok, as [From.GetSheHe] apparently has decided to not have any prepared. This is certainly not what I would have expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_659;I expected better!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_660;As I am exploring [From.GetBestName]'s palace during the Chuseok I come across another child doing likewise, and the two of us decide to explore together. Though I can tell that they are of low birth based on their clothing, their company is quite enjoyable, and they are fairly attractive as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_660;I'll give them a kiss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_660;I have no interest in kissing them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_661;It seems my companion liked the kiss as they quickly kiss me back, and though we continue on our way through the palace soon enough we end up stopping to kiss several more times before we have to part ways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_661;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_662;One of my servants have let me know that [From.GetBestName] was seen walking around in the company of the child of another servant. The servant that told me this suggests that the two children might have been kissing, and I need to decide how to handle the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_662;Pay the child's family to move away;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_662;Arrange an "accident" for the child;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_662;Ignore the matter;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_663;Though I feared that [From.GetBestName] would have learned that I and [chuseok_kisser.GetBestName] were kissing and would have taken action it seems that I did not need to worry, and I now have a new and rather close friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_663;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_665;I and [chuseok_kisser.GetBestName] have been quite close since we first met, and every now and then we have found ourselves kissing one another. Maybe there is more to it than the two of us being particularly close friends?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_665;I will approach [chuseok_kisser.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_665;I've outgrown any such attraction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_666;I have been close to [From.GetBestName] ever since we met, and there has been at least some attraction between us since then as we have found ourselves kissing every now and then. Today [From.GetBestName] suggested that we perhaps should take things further than just kissing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_666;I thought you'd never ask!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_666;I'm sorry, but I don't feel that way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_667;[From.GetBestName] was quite receptive to my suggestion that the two of us should do more than just kiss one another, and as we both knew of several secluded locations it was easy to slip away from the eyes of the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_667;This day turned out very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_668;Though I had expected [From.GetBestName] to be receptive to the idea of doing more than just kissing it seems that [From.GetSheHe] did not think that was a good idea. [From.GetSheHeCap] did however say that [From.GetSheHe] hopes we still can be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_668;Of course we can still be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_668;I am done with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_669;I had initially feared that rejecting [From.GetBestName]'s advances might ruin our friendship, but [From.GetSheHe] seems to have handled being rejected gracefully enough and does not seem to be holding it against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_669;That's good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_670;I had thought that turning down [From.GetBestName] gently would let the two of us remain friends, but it seems [From.GetSheHe] is unaccustomed to not getting what [From.GetSheHe] wants as [From.GetSheHe] told me that [From.GetSheHe] no longer wishes to associate with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_670;I don't know what I expected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_671;The other child and I keep on exploring the palace for a while, and though I still think that they are somewhat attractive I keep my distance from them. After all, there might be rumours if I did something, and that might be bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_671;I can wait until marriage...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_672;As I'm heading back to my quarters during a lull in the Chuseok I am approached by a rather attractive servant in the hallway. They tell me they are there to help me with anything I might require, and I wonder if I perhaps should give them a kiss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_672;I'll give them a kiss!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_672;I'll keep my distance...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_673;The attractive servant seems to appreciate my kiss, but though I perhaps could have taken things further I feel that it is important for me to get back to the other guests sooner rather than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_673;Maybe I'll see them later?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_674;The attractive servant, [chuseok_kisser.GetBestName], clearly appreciates the kiss, and [chuseok_kisser.GetSheHe] asks if I wish for [chuseok_kisser.GetHerHim] to join me in my bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_674;Yes, and I'd like you to join my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_674;Yes, but only this once...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_674;It would be a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_675;Though the servant is rather attractive, it would be anything but sensible to give them a kiss, and I inform them that I do not particularly require their services at the moment. As I return to the other guests, I become convinced that I made the right decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_675;It would have been a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_676;There are several interesting people at the Chuseok. One of them, [chuseok_tumble_2.GetBestName], is particularly noteworthy, and I feel that the way they behave around me perhaps is indicative of them wanting to get to know me rather more intimately. Perhaps I should ask them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_676;I will approach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_676;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_677;I have been having a good time at the Chuseok, meeting all kinds of interesting people. One of them, [From.GetBestName], seems quite taken with me, and [From.GetSheHe] discreetly approaches me to inquire if I wish to spend some time with [From.GetHerHim] somewhere more private.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_677;That's just what I wanted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_677;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_678;It seems I misinterpreted what [From.GetBestName] wanted as [From.GetSheHe] has informed me that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in going off somewhere more private with me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_678;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_679;It is not particularly hard for me and [From.GetBestName] to slip away from the other guests and find somewhere we can get to know one another more intimately. As we are getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] asks me if we should try to meet again later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_679;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_679;It's best to not do it again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_680;It was not particularly difficult for me and [From.GetBestName] to find somewhere private to get to know each other much more intimately. As we are getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] makes it clear that [From.GetSheHe] is looking forward to another similar opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_680;That sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_681;It was not particularly difficult for me and [From.GetBestName] to find somewhere private to get to know each other much more intimately. Though you have an enjoyable time [From.GetSheHe] makes it clear that [From.GetSheHe] does not want to make a habit out of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_681;Maybe that's for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_682;As part of the Chuseok festivities [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to set aside some time for ssireum wrestling. A number of wrestlers have been brought in from nearby, but [From.GetBestName] has indicated theat [From.GetHerHis] guests could join in if they wanted to. The question is, do I want to do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_682;I want to wrestle [chuseok_ssireum_opponent_1.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_682;[chuseok_ssireum_opponent_2.GetBestName] seems like a good opponent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_682;I challenge you, [chuseok_ssireum_opponent_3.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_682;I'd rather just watch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_683;As I and the other guests at [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s Chuseok are about to watch some ssireum wrestling [From.GetBestName] surprises me by walking up to me and challenging me. It'd certainly be possible to refuse, even if some people might not approve of the refusal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_683;Challenge... accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_683;I'd rather just watch...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_684;I would have thought that [From.GetBestName] would have been willing to wrestle me, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] did not like that suggestion, claiming that [From.GetSheHe] would rather watch the other contestants than participate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_684;Is [From.GetSheHe] a coward, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_685;[From.GetBestName] accepts my suggestion that the two of us should wrestle one another, and as best I can tell [From.GetSheHe] is fairly eager to get underway. We should be able to get the first bout, if we move quickly enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_685;Let's speak to [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_686;As the ssireum wrestling at the Chuseok is about to begin I am approached by [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName], who tell me that they would like to wrestle one another and would prefer to get the first bout. This is a bit surprising, perhaps, but there is little reason to refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_686;I'll allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_687;As the ssireum wrestling at the Chuseok is about to begin [From.GetBestName] suddenly announces that there will be a special bout to begin with, involving [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_687;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_688;As I and [chuseok_ssireum_opponent.GetBestName] are being tied together for the ssireum wrestling I consider just how I should try to approach it, seeing as there are multiple ways I could attempt to gain the upper hand. No doubt my opponent is considering [chuseok_ssireum_opponent.GetHerHis] own strategy at this very moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_688;I will rely on my strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_688;I will rely on my endurance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_688;I will rely on a trick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_688;I will rely on my charms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_689;As I and [From.GetBestName] are being tied together for the ssireum wrestling I consider just how I should try to approach it, seeing as there are multiple ways I could attempt to gain the upper hand. No doubt my opponent is considering [From.GetHerHis] own strategy at this very moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_689;I will rely on my strength!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTC_SOH_689;I will rely on a trick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_SOH_689;I will rely on my charms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_691;At [From.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] start wrestling. Though my opponent is not entirely unprepared, [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetSheHe] is not able to withstand my strength, and it is not long before I am victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_691;Good game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_692;At [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [From.GetBestName] start wrestling. I am not entirely unprepared, but [From.GetSheHe] is stronger than I had expected, and it is not long before I touch the ground in a fashion that means I have lost the fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_692;Good game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_693;I give the signal for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. It quickly becomes apparent that [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] is significantly stronger than [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetHerHim] opponent, and [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetSheHe] wins easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_693;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_694;[From.GetBestName] signals for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. It quickly becomes apparent that [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] is significantly stronger than [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetHerHim] opponent, and [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetSheHe] wins easily enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_694;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_695;At [From.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] start wrestling. Though my opponent is not entirely unprepared, [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetSheHe] was clearly not expecting me to approach the fight carefully, and I eventually manage to defeat [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetHerHim] after [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetSheHe] has grown tired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_695;Good game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_696;At [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [From.GetBestName] start wrestling. I am not entirely unprepared, but [From.GetSheHe] is approaching the fight with a focus on outlasting me, and though it takes a while before I tire I am eventually overcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_696;Good game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_697;I give the signal for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. It quickly becomes apparent that [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] seeks to outlast [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName], and this approach is eventually proven to have been the right approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_697;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_698;From.GetBestName] signals for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. It quickly becomes apparent that [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] seeks to outlast [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName], and this approach is eventually proven to have been the right approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_698;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_699;At [From.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] start wrestling. My opponent was clearly expecting a straightforward and honorable fight, so my decision to trick [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetHerHim] catches [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetHerHim] by surprise, and I win almost as soon as the fight starts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_699;Easy game!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_700;At [From.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [From.GetBestName] start wrestling. I had expected [From.GetHerHim] to engage in a straightforward and honorable fight, and I am caught completely by surprise when [From.GetSheHe] uses a dirty trick to get ahead. The fight is over almost before it could begin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_700;That wasn't nice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_700;You'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_701;It seems [From.GetBestName] took the fact that I used a trick to defeat [From.GetHerHim] poorly as [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] looks forward to making me pay for what I did in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_701;As if I care!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_702;I give the signal for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. However, the fight is over almost as quickly as it begins, as [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] somehow gets [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] to the ground. Maybe there is some kind of trickery afoot, though it is impossible to tell for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_702;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_703;[From.GetBestName] signals for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. However, the fight is over almost as quickly as it begins, as [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] somehow gets [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] to the ground. Maybe there is some kind of trickery afoot, though it is impossible to tell for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_703;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_704;At [From.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] start wrestling. My opponent is caught by surprise as I suggest that being so close together resembles certain other, more intimate activities, and it is not terribly difficult to defeat [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetHerHim] once [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetSheHe] is distracted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_704;I knew [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetSheHe] would fall for that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_705;At [From.GetBestName]'s signal, I and [From.GetBestName] start wrestling. I am taken completely by surprise when my opponent quietly hints that being so close together makes [From.GetHerHim] think of other, more intimate activities, and before I can stop thinking about that comment I have been defeated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_705;Suggest doing something more intimate together;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_705;Shake [From.GetHerHis] hand and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_706;As I and [From.GetBestName] are moving aside to let other ssireum wrestlers wrestle [From.GetSheHe] quietly asks me if I want to head somewhere private to engage in some of those other activities I mentioned while we were wrestling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_706;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_706;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_707;It seems I misjudged [From.GetBestName]'s reasons for bringing up intimate activities while we were wrestling, as [From.GetSheHe] informs me that [From.GetSheHe] has no interest in engaging in any such activities with me, at least not at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_707;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_708;[From.GetBestName] gladly accepts my suggestion, and with the others at the Chuseok distracted by further bouts of ssireum between others it is easy enough for the two of us to slip away. As we are getting dressed again I consider whether we should leave things as they are or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_708;We should do this again!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_708;That was a one-time thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_709;With the other guests distracted by further bouts of ssireum between others it is easy enough for me and [From.GetBestName] to slip away from them and find someplace private. As we are getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks we should keep seeing each other in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_709;Sounds great to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_710;With the other guests distracted by further bouts of ssireum between others it is easy enough for me and [From.GetBestName] to slip away from them and find someplace private. As we are getting dressed again [From.GetSheHe] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it is best for us to not keep seeing each other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_710;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_711;I give the signal for the ssireum wrestling to begin, and the two wrestlers begin right away. However, the fight is over almost as quickly as it begins, as [chuseok_ssireum_winner.GetBestName] somehow gets [chuseok_ssireum_loser.GetBestName] to the ground. Maybe there is some kind of trickery afoot, though it is impossible to tell for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_711;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_712;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_713;The ssireum wrestling at my Chuseok was interesting to watch, even if none of the wrestlers were particularly noteworthy. I think my guests were entertained as well, which is a good thing indeed as I would be a poor host if I bored them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_713;Well, that was entertaining...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_714;[From.GetBestName] has arranged for some ssireum wrestling at [From.GetHerHis] Chuseok, and it is a fun diversion from other activities. Maybe the wrestlers are not the most skilled ones I have seen, but they certainly were not boring to watch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_714;Well, that was entertaining...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_715;One of the ssireum wrestlers entertaining the guests at my Chuseok truly is a skilled [ssireum_champion.GetManWoman]. Though of low birth, [ssireum_champion.GetSheHe] could perhaps be of some use to me in the future, and I doubt [ssireum_champion.GetSheHe] would refuse an offer to join my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_715;I could use a [ssireum_champion.GetManWoman] like you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_715;I don't need [ssireum_champion.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_717;No Chuseok would be complete without women dancing the Ganggangsullae, and it is of course part of my Chuseok. The dancers I have hired are quite skilled at both dancing and singing, as one would expect, and as best I can tell my guests are quite appreciative, with several female guests joining in.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_717;It's certainly nice to watch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_717;I think I'll join in too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_718;I move to join the Ganggangsullae dancers in their dancing and singing, and though I do not have as much experience as they have I find it easy enough to figure out how to do well. When I am done dancing several of the guests and dancers compliment my skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_718;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_719;I move to join the Ganggangsullae dancers in their dancing and singing, but though I expected that it would be easy enough to get the hang of it I find myself tripping over my feet and disrupting the other dancers. Nobody says anything, but I am certain many consider my dancing embarrassing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_719;That was not a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_720;;No Chuseok would be complete without women dancing the Ganggangsullae, and it is of course part of [From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok.

EVTOPTA_SOH_722;That was not a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_723;As the Ganggangsullae dancing is dying down one of the more attractive dancers makes her way over to me, telling me that she hopes that I appreciated what I saw. She suggests that if that is the case we should head somewhere private to engage in other activities, and I have little doubt what she means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_723;I like the way you think!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_723;Sorry, but no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_724;It is easy enough for me and [chuseok_pretty_dancer.GetBestName] to sneak away and find somewhere private to engage in various intimate activities. Quite a bit later, as we are getting dressed, she asks me if I want to see her again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_724;Yes, that would be wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_724;No, that would be a mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_725;Though it is not as important a tradition as songpyeon, it is not uncommon for there to be hangwa at the Chuseok, and [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to ensure that there is a massive amount of hangwa for [From.GetHerHis] guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_725;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_725;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_727;Though it is not as important a tradition as songpyeon, it is not uncommon for there to be hangwa at the Chuseok, but it seems [From.GetBestName] has decided not to prepare any for [From.GetHerHis] guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_727;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_727;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_SOH_727;Say nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_728;It seems my decision regarding how much hangwa should be served was to [From.GetBestName]'s liking, as [From.GetSheHe] just approached me to let me know that [From.GetSheHe] wholly approves of my decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_728;That's good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_729;[From.GetBestName] just approached me to let me know that the amount of hangwa served at my Chuseok was not to [From.GetHerHis] liking. I did not expect everyone to be happy, but I had hoped that nobody would complain to my face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_729;You can't please everyone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_730;My decision to ensure that there would be a lot to drink at my Chuseok seems to have been the right one, as I and all of my guests are having a good time. I am not sure why I was remotely concerned that it could have been the wrong idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_730;Pour me some more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_731;Though it was a good idea to serve a lot of drinks at first, I really should have been careful about how much I had to drink. Last night was a blur, and I am unable to remember much of what happened. Even worse, I woke up with a severe headache this morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_731;That... was a mistake;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_732;[From.GetBestName] has ensured that there is a lot to drink at [From.GetHerHis] Chuseok, and though there perhaps are those that would caution serving a lot of strong drinks because of the risk of rowdy guests everyone is having a good time as far as I can see.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_732;Pour me some more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_733;Though seemed like a good idea at the time, I really should have been careful about how much I had to drink. Last night was a blur, and I am unable to remember much of what happened. Even worse, I woke up with a severe headache this morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_733;That... was a mistake;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_734;It is uncertain if the decision to serve a moderate amount of drinks at the Chuseok was the right one, but as best I can tell my guests are reasonably satisfied with their drinks, and they are certainly not being rowdy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_734;I don't think anyone is unhappy, at least...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_735;My decision to avoid serving strong drinks at my Chuseok was made with good intentions in mind, but it does not seem as if my guests approve of the decision in the slightest. In fact, some of them seem a bit offended when I suggest that it was done to avoid rowdiness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_735;That was a mistake...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_736;[From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok has been rather disappointing in one regard, as [From.GetSheHe] has decided that there will be no strong drinks available at all. I asked [From.GetHerHim] about it, and it seems [From.GetSheHe] thinks the guests would have been rowdy if there had drinks, which is not a reasonable concern.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_736;We should have gotten proper drinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_737;The Chuseok is coming to a close, and it is time for my guests to depart and for me to return to dealing with other matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_737;I had fun, and so did my guests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_738;[From.GetBestName]'s Chuseok is coming to a close, and it is time to head home and get back to other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_738;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_739;As war has broken out it no longer possible to hold a Chuseok. I expect my guests to accept this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_739;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_740;[From.GetBestName] has been forced to cancel [From.GetHerHis] Chuseok due to a war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_740;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
