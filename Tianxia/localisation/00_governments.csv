eastern_imperial_government_desc;Though not going so far as to claim the Mandate of Heaven, rulers with the Eastern Imperial government emulate the Chinese Imperial system even more thoroughly than those with the Confucian Bureaucracy government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_imperial_government;Japanese Imperial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_imperial_government_desc;Though taking some inspiration from the Chinese Imperial government, the Japanese Imperial government is structured somewhat differently and has discarded the concept of the Mandate of Heaven. The Imperial Family's sole right to the Chrysanthemum Throne is universally seen as unquestionable... but the Tenno being a mere figurehead is not necessarily a controversial idea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_bureaucracy_government;Japanese Bureaucracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_bureaucracy_government_desc;Greatly inspired by the government system of the Tang dynasty, the Japanese Bureaucracy government is supposed to be a bureaucratic meritocracy, but many see it as just a stepping stone on the way to something along feudal lines.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_feudal_government;Japanese Feudal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
japanese_feudal_government_desc;While slightly different from the Feudal government, the Japanese Feudal government is a close approximation, with the primary difference being an inability to demand conversion or revoke titles on religious grounds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

japanese_monastic_feudal_government_desc;The Japanese Monastic Feudal government is unique among the Japanese governments in that it allows the holder to demand religious conversion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3504;[Root.GetTennoKogo] [From.GetFirstName] has died without an heir. While [From.GetSheHe] was a mortal [From.GetManWoman] like any other and [From.GetHerHis] death thus was to be expected sooner or later, the lack of a member of the Imperial Family to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne is unprecedented, seeing as the Imperial Family has possessed it since time immemorial.\n\nWith the succession unclear, [Root.GetTennoKogo] [From.GetFirstName]'s former realm has crumbled, and the belief of many of the Shinto faithful has crumbled alongside it, with many abandoning their faith altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_SOH_3525;Perhaps there are other options?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3526;It seems [From.GetBestName] has leveraged [From.GetHerHis] considerable influence at court to secure more power for [From.GetHerselfHimself] at my expense. Sadly, I am in no position to oppose this for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3526;[From.GetSheHeCap] forgets [From.GetHerHis] place...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3527;Even though there are many in [From.GetBestName]'s court that are well aware that it is in the interest of the realm for me to have rather considerable authority it seems [From.GetBestName] has still managed to leverage [From.GetHerHis] influence to somewhat reduce my authority.
EVTOPTA_SOH_3527;[From.GetSheHeCap] is perhaps not content as a puppet...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3590;[Root.GetBestName]\nI have decided that it would be in the interest of the realm for you to marry [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. I have taken the liberty of ensuring that the wedding can take place immediately.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3590;I guess I have a new wife...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3528;[From.GetBestName] has come to the conclusion that some of my wealth would be better in [From.GetHerHis] hands. [From.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.GetSheHe] will be spending it in a fashion that will benefit the realm, but I have my doubts that that is the truth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3528;[From.GetSheHeCap] is just a common thief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3529;[From.GetBestName] came to see me today and wasted no time before informing me that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it would be best for the realm if I spent the next year far, far away from government affairs. [From.GetSheHeCap] also let me know that [From.GetSheHe] has seen fit to assign me a large number of guards to ensure everything goes as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3529;I... have no choice...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3530;I have just received word that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to release [From.GetBestName] from prison, supposedly acting in my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3530;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] didn't even ask me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3532;I have just received word that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to execute one of my prisoners, [From.GetBestName], supposedly acting in my name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3532;[FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] didn't even ask me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3534;It seems [FromFrom.GetBestName] has decided that [From.GetBestName] being on the council is not to [FromFrom.GetHerHis] liking, as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has let [From.GetBestName] know that [From.GetHerHis] presence no longer is desired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3534;At least [From.GetBestName] does not blame me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3535;I have just been informed by [FromFrom.GetBestName] that I am not welcome at any more council meetings for the time being, supposedly because the realm would benefit more from someone else in my old position.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3535;This wasn't [Root.Liege.GetBestName]'s idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3538;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that the realm would be better served by [From.GetBestName] being my direct vassal, and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this indeed is the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3538;I am in no position to oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3539;[ROOT:GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that the realm is better served by you being my direct vassal, and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this is indeed the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3539;I suppose that's fine...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SOH_3539;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3540;[Root.GetBestName]\nIt is clear to me that it would be best for the realm if I personally held [From.GetName], and I have taken the necessary steps to ensure that this indeed is the case.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3540;I am in no position to oppose this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3541;[Root.GetBestName],\nIt is apparent to everyone that you currently are unfit to serve as the Permanent Regent, and everyone agrees that I should serve in your stead. I am sure you will see things my way, at least in time.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3541;I'll remember this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3542;[Root.GetBestName],\nI am pleased to inform you that our combined efforts have paid off. I am now the Permanent Regent for [Root.Liege.GetBestName], and my tenure will continue indefinitely, for the good of the realm.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SOH_3542;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3543;[Root.GetBestName],\nYour former Permanent Regent was obviously unfit to serve, so I have taken the liberty to take over the Permanent Regency.

EVTOPTA_SOH_3543;I suppose this is no worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SOH_3544;[Root.GetBestName],\nIt is clear that the realm would only benefit from a Permanent Regency under me. I suggest that you agree with this demand, as I and my backers otherwise will compel you by force of arms.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_SOH_3547;[Root.GetBestName],\nYour claim that a Permanent Regency would be best for the realm is false, and your attempt to take power from me is treason. My armies will be coming to arrest you and those who would side with you.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
