EVTDESC_TIANXIA_ORDERS_1;Fearing that the Buddhist faithful might not always see their interests taken care of in the Land of the Rising Sun [From.GetBestName] has taken the initiative to organize a brotherhood of warrior monks to safeguard those interests.\n\nNaming itself the Sohei, this warrior brotherhood is still in its infancy, and it is hard to say just what form their protection of the interests of the Buddhist religion will take, but it would be foolhardy to question the zeal of those who have seen fit to join its ranks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_TIANXIA_ORDERS_111;Let them come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_ORDERS_113;My [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledFirstName], has requested to join the Headhunters in their tireless defense of the faithful, even though this will forever disinherit him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_ORDERS_117;Great [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle], your extremely generous donation will aid us greatly as we fight against the enemies of the faith! Upon my honor, I shall not forget this charity!\n\nFor the defense of the faith!\nWarchief [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_TIANXIA_ORDERS_113;[This.GetTitledFirstName] becomes a Headhunter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_ORDERS_121;Most righteous [Root.GetTitledFirstName], the Headhunters are in need of more castles in order to train troops and generate a supporting income. There is a suitable location in your demesne - in [FromFrom.GetName] to be specific. I am willing to pay you 100 gold in exchange for the right to construct a fortress there.\n\nFor the defense of the faith!\nWarchiefaster [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_ORDERS_122;The Headhunters have constructed a castle in [Root.GetName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_TIANXIA_ORDERS_124;Your majesty, this antagonism is completely unwarranted! The Headhunters merely seek to protect the Kaharingan faith. Can you make that same claim?\n\nWith anger and sadness,\n\nWarchief [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;x
