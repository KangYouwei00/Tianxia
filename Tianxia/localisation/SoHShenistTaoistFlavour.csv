EVTDESC_SHENIST_3;Your [GetFromFromRelation], [FromFrom.GetBestName], is dead. Traditionally, you would be expected to undertake a three-year mourning period, but there are those that would argue that the work of governing your realm is more important than a long mourning period and that your ancestor would agree with this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_3;I will mourn as is proper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_3;I have better things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
in_mourning;In mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
in_mourning_desc;This character is mourning a deceased ancestor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_4;The three-year mourning period for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] is over, and it is time for you to get back to other things. You should of course not forget your ancestor even though you're no longer actively mourning, but even though you might miss them you cannot be excused from other things forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_4;It is time to move on;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_6;As you mourn for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] you remember that it is customary to wear more simple clothing, possibly even made from sackcloth, during the mourning period. Perhaps this would be an appropriate step, though you suspect that there also might be those that would look down on you for doing such a thing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_6;It is the proper thing to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_6;That would be too much;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_7;As part of the mourning for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] you have allowed your hair to become unkempt, as that is generally seen as the right thing to do. However, you are starting to feel that it perhaps has gone too far and that it would be right and proper to fix it before the situation gets worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_7;I should get cleaned up;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_7;That would be improper;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_8;To honor your ancestor, [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName], it might be proper to make an offering of incense. It is not strictly required, of course, but there are certainly those who would be put at ease by you showing respect towards a deceased ancestor in that way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_9;It is generally customary to have a very restricted diet during the mourning period, and that might be something for you to consider while mourning [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. However, it might also be good to eat properly to avoid getting too sick to continue the mourning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_9;A restricted diet is fine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_9;I will not go on a diet;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_10;As you mourn for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] you recall having heard that there are those that have created rituals that might let you communicate with the dead. As you own some writing on the subject, it is something you could look into during the mourning period.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_10;I will study these rituals;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_10;I doubt they work;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_11;You have spent quite some time mourning [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. Though you know that it is the proper thing to do, you can't quite shake the feeling that you could be putting your time to better use. After all, the dead are dead, and they probably don't care.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_11;This is pointless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_12;You have to admit to yourself that there was a time when you questioned whether mourning [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] was worth your time, but those days are past. [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHeCap] might be dead, but [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] is still watching over you, as are the rest of your dead ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_12;My ancestors must be honored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_13;Death is inevitable, you conclude as your mourn for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. You can spend your days being productive and attempt to live a healthy and safe life to postpone the inevitable, but it does not matter in the end. Everyone dies, and sooner or later everything you do in life stops mattering.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_13;Everything is pointless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_14;While you suppose that it is inevitable that you will die one day unless you unlock the secrets of immortality, that day might still be far away. While mourning [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] is proper, you need to remember that you have a life to live, and that you should not stop enjoying it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_14;Life isn't so bad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_15;Though [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] followed a religion that is different from yours, [ancestor_to_mourn.GetSheHe] still was your ancestor, and it is proper to respect the ways of your ancestors even when they are different from what you are used to. Who knows, perhaps they have the answers to some questions your religion doesn't?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_15;I should be more respectful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_16;While being humble generally is seen as appropriate during the mourning period, you can't quite shake the feeling that perhaps it would be more appropriate to make an extravagant offering to [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] to show that you truly respect them. Chances are this would impress their other descendants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_16;I should make a large offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_16;That would be a waste of money;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_large_ancestor_offering_beatification;Honored my ancestor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
opinion_large_ancestor_offering;Honored my ancestor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_17;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to make a large offering to [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName]. Though not required as part of the mourning, you have to admit that it is a sign of respect towards the deceased, even if you have to admit that it also is a display of power rather than humility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_17;It is still respectful;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_18;You have been mourning [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] for some time, though the usual three years have not yet gone by. However, perhaps it is time to move on, as there surely is work that has piled up in your absence? Some might fault you for not mourning for longer, but it is ultimately your decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_18;This has gone on long enough;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SHENIST_18;I am not done mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_19;Though it is unfortunate that [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has died, the mourning period has finally allowed you to relax from the numerous things that usually take up your day. You might have been doing some important things before, of course, but at times it seemed far too much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_19;I needed a break;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_20;While there are those that feel that it is proper to always work to improve yourself and your realm, the mourning period for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has opened your eyes to the truth, which is that you should actually be working less. After all, you only live for so long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_20;I should take it easy more often;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SHENIST_21;Though the mourning period for [ancestor_to_mourn.GetBestName] has not lasted for the full three years it is undeniable that the war that has broken out must take precedence. Your ancestors would definitely agree that protecting yourself and your lands is what you should be doing right now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SHENIST_21;It is time to stop mourning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
