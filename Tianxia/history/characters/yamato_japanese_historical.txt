# Historical Yamato/Japanese characters 1000008700-1000008999
# First unused index: 1000008700

# Swap from Yamato to Japanese around 800-850 (for the Imperial Family, it would be the children of Junna and Ninmyo), but let people alive at that point remain Yamato since it is a parent culture and thus not a cause for rebellion

##### The Imperial Family

# People before Emperor Keitai have been skipped
# All of these should have the amaterasu_descendant trait
# Includes people that later founded Minamoto/Taira/Tachibana branches, but not their descendants
