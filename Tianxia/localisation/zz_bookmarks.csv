BM_INTERESTING_TIMES_INFO;The Middle Kingdom is in turmoil, and has been that way ever since Taizu of Liang overthrew the Tang dynasty nearly three decades ago. Six would-be Emperors of China -- Li Congke of Tang, Liao (Yelu) Deguang of Liao, Shi Jingtang of Jin, Meng Chang of Shu, Yang Pu of Wu, and Liu Yan of Han -- all claim to possess the Mandate of Heaven, but whether one of them, one of their descendants, or someone else will prevail over the others has yet to be determined. Perhaps none of them will prevail and someone else will manage to secure the Dragon Throne, or perhaps the Middle Kingdom will never recover, which no doubt would please at least some of those who have lived in the shadow of the Dragon in the past.
