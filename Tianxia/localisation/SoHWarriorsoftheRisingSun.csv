EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_32B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt displeases me and all other Warriors of the Rising Sun that you have failed to defeat your hated rival in a War of Honor.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_38;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI might be prepared to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun as you ask, but before I can tell if I am prepared to do that you will have to show me how well you fight.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_38;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_38;I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_39;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am a busy [From.GetWomanMan] and am uncertain as to whether I would be able to find the time to mentor you.

EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_39;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_40;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI can see why you would want me to mentor you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and I might be willing to do you that favor, but in that case I would ask a favor in return...\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_40;Sure, I'll owe you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_40;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_41;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou may have been allowed to join the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, but that does not entitle you to my guidance.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_41;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_42;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. In your experience, new members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun are generally somewhat lacking in skill regardless of their background, but [From.GetBestName] is truly skilled, and it is even possible that [From.GetSheHe] would end up teaching you more than you could teach [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_42;I will suggest a better mentor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_42;I will mentor them, even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_42;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_43;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. While you notice some areas where [From.GetSheHe] might be lacking, these flaws are rather minor, and you must admit that those that taught [From.GetBestName] to fight did a very good job that you cannot improve upon very much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_43;I will mentor them, even so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_43;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_44;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. You notice some flaws, but also some strengths, and in your opinion [From.GetBestName] is about as skilled as the average new member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun is expected to be. You could certainly help [From.GetHerHim] improve a little, and it would likely not be too difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_44;I will teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_44;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_45;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. You notice a few promising areas, but on the whole [From.GetSheHe] is a rather poor warrior, and it would likely take quite some work to help [From.GetHerHim] improve to the point where they would perform adequately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_45;I'm willing to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_45;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_46;[From.GetBestName] arrives without delay and eagerly shows what [From.GetSheHe] is capable of as a warrior. To call [From.GetHerHis] performance "bad" would be charitable, to say the least, and it would doubtlessly be a major undertaking to make [From.GetHerHim] perform at even the lowest level you would deem acceptable for a WArrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_46;I do like a challenge!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_46;I refuse to help them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_47;Despite giving [From.GetBestName] a fair opportunity to prove [From.GetHerselfHimself] worthy of being your student, which is well within your rights, [From.GetSheHe] does not agree to the idea, seemingly operating under the impression that all [From.GetSheHe] has to do is ask.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_47;In that case, I must refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_48;It seems you have impressed [From.GetBestName] with your skills to a greater extent than you would have thought possible as [From.GetSheHe] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] is uncertain whether [From.GetSheHe] could teach you much, suggesting that [better_mentor.GetBestName] might be a better mentor. [From.GetBestName] has offered to ask [better_mentor.GetHerHim] for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_48;Sounds like a plan!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_48;No, I want you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_49;Though you would have expected [From.GetBestName] to accept your offer to try to get [better_mentor.GetBestName] to teach [From.GetHerHim] instead as that likely would be more beneficial [From.GetBestName] surprises you by demanding that you mentor [From.GetHerHim] personally since [From.GetSheHe] saw fit to ask you rather than [better_mentor.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_49;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_49;In that case, I refuse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_50;While your request seems to have taken [From.GetBestName] by surprise it evidently was a good idea to ask as [From.GetSheHe] has agreed to take you on despite [From.GetHerHis] initial reservations. Perhaps you will not learn as much as you might be able to learn with another mentor, but you might also prove yourself worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun much sooner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_50;As I predicted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_51;It seems you displeased [From.GetBestName] by insisting that [From.GetSheHe] should mentor you personally as [From.GetSheHe] has refused to entertain the notion and has rescinded [From.GetHerHis] previous offer to help you get another mentor. You will have to ask someone else in person, it would seem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_51;That was unexpected...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_52;A messenger has arrived from [FromFrom.GetBestName], telling you that [From.GetBestName] approached [FromFrom.GetBestName] in the hopes of being mentored and that [From.GetBestName] was skilled enough that [FromFrom.GetBestName] thinks that [FromFrom.GetHerHis] skills would be insufficient. [FromFrom.GetBestName] suggests that you would make for a better mentor for [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_52;I would be happy to teach them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_52;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_53;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that I have seen fit to accept you as my student, as requested by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. I hope that this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_53;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_54;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI hereby inform you that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has accepted me as [FromFrom.GetHerHis] student. I thank you for your help in arranging this.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_54;It was my pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_55;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] speaks highly of you I do not think it would be in my interests to mentor you as [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] has requested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_55;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_56;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nDespite your letter to [FromFrom.GetHerHim] [FromFrom.GetBestName] has refused to mentor me. I ask that you mentor me instead, as I initially requested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_56;I'll do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_56;I won't mentor you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_57;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIf [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you then I am prepared to do so, in accordance with what you initially suggested.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_57;Works for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_58;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am surprised that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] is unwilling to mentor you, but though it certainly is not ideal for you I am still not prepared to mentor you personally.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_58;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_59;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYou have performed quite well, and I would definitely be willing to mentor you so that you may learn what little you have to learn before you have proven yourself.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_59;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_60;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, but I am still willing to mentor you so that you may become truly worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_60;Well, that's fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_61;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile your performance was decent enough I must say that I would rather not mentor you. Go find someone else that would be willing to do that.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_61;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_62;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour performance was not particularly impressive, and I therefore have no interest in mentoring you. I wish you better luck elsewhere.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_61;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_63;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nWhile I am surprised to learn that you would go as far as to demand money in exchange for mentoring me I still think that that is an acceptable bargain.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_63;A deal is a deal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_64;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI think it is quite dishonest of you to demand money in exchange for mentoring me, and I have no interest in any such arrangement.

I hope we can be friends, or at least not rivals.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_68C;[Root.GetBestName],\n[From.GetBestName] will be mentoring me from now on, and I look forward to proving that I am your superior in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_68;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_68;Let's see what the future holds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_68;You are a fool to oppose me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_69A;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI am quite happy to hear that we now share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName] and look forward to spending more time together.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_69B;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nI have been told that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has seen fit to mentor you as well. I hope we can be friends, or at least not rivals.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_69C;[Root.GetBestName],\nI hear [From.GetBestName] will be mentoring you from now on, and I look forward to proving that I am your superior in every way and that you are unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetBestName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_69;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_69;Let's see what the future holds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_69;You are a fool to oppose me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_70;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nIt has come to my attention that you do not have a mentor, and without a mentor it will be impossible for you to prove yourself worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. I would be happy to mentor you, if that is acceptable.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[FromFrom.GetSocietyRank] [FromFrom.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_70;That works for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_70;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_71;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is most definitely welcome, and I see no reason not to accept. I hope that this will be mutually beneficial.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_71;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_72;[Root.GetSocietyRank] [Root.GetFirstName],\nYour offer to mentor me is kind, but I think that another mentor would be more beneficial for me, so I must refuse your offer.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetSocietyRank] [From.GetFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_72;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_76;As part of your mentoring duties you are expected to help [From.GetBestName] improve [From.GetHerHis] skills when it comes to a variety of weapons. One of those weapons is the sword, which many would consider the most important weapon in the arsenal of any warrior. Perhaps it is time to give [From.GetBestName] a swordfighting lesson?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_76;"The sword is an elegant weapon...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_76;I have better things to do!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_77;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has seen fit to plan a swordfighting lesson for you, stating that it is something that [From.GetSheHe] thinks is a mandatory part of the training that every Warrior of the Rising Sun must undergo.\n\n"The sword is an elegant weapon...," [From.GetSheHe] tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_77;"... for a civilized age!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_77;I don't have time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_78;While other, less civilized, cultures might think that the bow is a weapon that is only fit for hunting for for the peasantry, you know better, and you also know that the rest of the Warriors of the Rising Sun think likewise. It would probably not be amiss to spend some time working on marksmanship as part of your mentoring of [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_78;I should give [From.GetHerHim] a few tips!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_78;I have other plans!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_79;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has announced that [From.GetSheHe] think it would be wise for the two of you to dedicate some time towards working on your skills with a bow, stating that it is good for every warrior to be a skilled archer. Of course, while you know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun tend to use bows from time to time you have also heard that others look down on archers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_79;I think archery is useful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_79;This is not for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_80;Though the sword obviously is the weapon that a true Warrior of the Rising Sun should prefer in melee combat there are situations where a spear is more useful, and it would probably be amiss not to give [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to handle that weapon in case [From.GetSheHe] should need it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_80;I can give a few tips...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_80;Let's not bother with this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_81;Though you have been told that the sword is the best weapon for melee combat, your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has also suggested that there are situations where it might be a good idea to use something else, and now [From.GetSheHe] is suggesting that the two of you should spend some time practicing with a spear in case you ever need to use one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_81;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_81;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_82;Though it would not be amiss to spend some time giving [From.GetBestName] a lesson in how to fight on horseback, it would probably also be a good idea to spend some time just working on basic horsemanship as there are those that end up neglecting that to their detriment because they focus too much on mounted combat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_82;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_82;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_83;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], surprises you one day by announcing that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that the two of you should spend the day riding and that the day's activities should not involve weapon practice. Perhaps there is wisdom in that suggestion, as knowing how to handle a horse without a weapon at the ready could be important, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_83;Saddle my horse!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_83;Maybe later...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_84;While you have heard it said that there are less civilized cultures that look down on a [Root.GetWomanMan] using a bow from horseback on the battlefield instead of fighting with a close range weapon during mounted combat, you know that the Warriors of the Rising Sun do not share that belief. Perhaps it is time to instruct [From.GetBestName] in mounted archery?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_84;That will be today's lesson!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_84;I don't want to do this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_85;[From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] intends for your next lesson to be on the matter of mounted archery, stating that it is a perfectly valid approach to combat despite what some foreign barbarians might think. You are of course familiar with using a bow from horseback already, but perhaps it would not be amiss to go along with the plan even so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_85;Sounds good to me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_85;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_86;The sword is a useful weapon, and is generally what one would expect a warrior to use when fighting a duel on foot or in many other combat circumstances. However, it is also a weapon that can be used on horseback, and it might be a good idea to have a lesson on the subject as part of [From.GetBestName]'s training, seeing as it could be useful when fighting as a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_86;It is certainly worthwhile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_86;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_87;[From.GetBestName] has sent you instructions to ready your horse and bring your sword as well, stating that your next lesson should be on the subject of mounted swordsmanship. Even though you know that the general sentiment among the Warriors of the Rising Sun is that fighting on foot with your sword is the most honorable approach to combat, this lesson might still be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_87;Great idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_87;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_88;Using a spear on horseback is a bit different from using one on foot. As part of the mentoring of [From.GetBestName], it might be valuable to spend some time working on the mounted approach, as there are sadly warriors who neglect it in favor of either fighting with a spear on foot or using another weapon on horseback even when those fighting styles are inferior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_88;Time to saddle up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_88;It would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_89;One day your mentor, [From.GetBestName], informs you that [From.GetSheHe] intends to give you a lesson in how to use a spear in mounted combat. While you already have some idea of how that works, it would perhaps not be amiss to spend some time working on it even so as [From.GetBestName] perhaps has a few useful tips you haven't heard before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_89;Fetch me a horse and a spear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_89;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_90;Though a Warrior of the Rising Sun is expected to keep a sword within reach at nearly all times and usually also will be keeping other weapons on hand there might be circumstances where a warrior is separated from all of their weapons. Though this is a shameful situation, knowing how to fight without weapons might still be good, and training [From.GetBestName] in unarmed combat might be wise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_90;Time to put weapons aside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_90;This seems unnecessary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_91;To your surprise, [From.GetBestName] tells you to put your weapons aside one day when your lessons are about to begin, stating that it would be a good idea for you to learn how to fight if you end up being separated from your weapons for one reason or another. While it woudl be shameful to be caught in such a situation, it would probably be less shameful if you knew what to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_91;This might be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_91;This does not interest me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_92;A Warrior of the Rising Sun is supposed to be honorable at all times, and there are few things as honorable as ensuring that the law is followed at all times. This is probably not unknown to [From.GetBestName], but as [From.GetHerHis] mentor it might be good for you to ensure that [From.GetSheHe] is aware of this being the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_92;This is important!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_92;I don't have time for this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_93;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss your opinions on the subject of laws and justice. [From.GetSheHeCap] is quite pleased when [From.GetSheHe] hears that the two of you are in agreement on the subject, stating that there are other Warriors of the Rising Sun that have other, incorrect, opinions on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_93;Justice will be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_94;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], sets some time aside one day to discuss your opinions on the subject of laws and justice. You know that all Warriors of the Rising Sun are supposed to be honorable, and that there are those that think that being honorable and following the law is the same thing, but until now you haven't really considered your position on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_94;Justice is the right path!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_94;Laws sometimes have to be broken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_95;While the Warriors of the Rising Sun are open to having members that aren't [Root.Religion.GetName] and on rare occasions have permitted members that have quite exotic religions, it is rather doubtful that foreign ways are fully compatible with being an honorable warrior. Perhaps it would be wise to instruct [From.GetBestName] about the dangers of foreign ways?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_95;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_95;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_96;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], seems to be concerned by the fact that foreign barbarians might have religions that are inherently incompatible with being honorable, as [From.GetSheHe] spends a large part of a day talking about the matter and how it is important for all Warriors of the Rising Sun to be on their guard against those following such religions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_96;Their foreign ways must be avoided!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_96;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_97;Your religion has sometimes been something of a sore point when it comes to your interactions with other Warriors of the Rising Sun, as there are those that think that your faith is too foreign to be something that an honorable warrior could follow. As part of mentoring [From.GetBestName], it might be possible to evoke sympathy, so that you might have one less enemy in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_97;This is an opportunity...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_97;This would be a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_98;It is well known that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], follows a religion that is quite unusual for a Warrior of the Rising Sun, and there are those that think that this makes [From.GetHerHim] inherently dishonorable. Your mentor has been telling you that the [From.Religion.GetName] religion is not as dishonorable as people might think, and seems to have arguments to back this up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_98;Well, they seem alright to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_98;Your religion is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_99;Your student, [From.GetBestName], is not a follower of one of the main religions of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and though there are those that think that foreign religions always are dishonorable you have to admit that [From.GetBestName] is honorable. Perhaps there is some merit to not dismissing an entire religion out of hand, as that might cloud your judgement on other issues as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_99;I should keep an open mind...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_99;Those ways are wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_100;You are surprised to learn that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], is not as prejudiced towards the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as many other Warriors of the Rising Sun have been in the past. [From.GetSheHeCap] has even gone as far as saying that your honor proves that it would be foolish to dismiss an entire religion as being inherently dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_100;I'm glad to hear that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_101;Both you and your student, [From.GetBestName], follow faiths that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and you are reasonably certain that both of you have faced prejudice as a result. Though your beliefs do not match, perhaps it would be good for both of you to respect each other's faith in the hopes of others doing the same towards you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_101;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_101;Their faith is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_102;Both you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], follow faiths that are quite different from those that most members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun follow, and you are reasonably certain that both of you have faced prejudice as a result. Though your beliefs do not match, perhaps it would be good for both of you to respect each other's faith in the hopes of others doing the same towards you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_102;Let's learn from each other!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_102;Their faith is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_103;Your student, [From.GetBestName], and you are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, which often is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun hold against you. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice you face will disappear anytime soon, it is certainly good to know that you have a potential ally of the same faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_103;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_104;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], and you are both devout followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, which often is something that other Warriors of the Rising Sun hold against you. Given that it is doubtful that the prejudice you face will disappear anytime soon, it is certainly good to know that you have a potential ally of the same faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_104;We're in this together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_105;[From.GetBestName] has been your student for a while, and you feel that the two of you have become quite close as a result. Perhaps your relationship should change from simply being a relationship between metor and student and take on a more intimate character? You're certain it isn't completely unheard of for that to happen, so even if it was discovered others would probably not think less of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_105;I will proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_105;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_106;[From.GetBestName] has been mentoring you in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a while, and the two of you have become rather close as a result. Even so, you are taken by surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps the two of you should have a more intimate relationship than you currently have, even though you know that it isn't completely unheard of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_106;What a lovely idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_106;Me and [From.GetHerHim]? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_107;[From.GetBestName] was quite flattered by your suggestion, and it did not take the two of you a long time to find a secluded location for lovemaking. Though you certainly still need to spend some time on activities related to training [From.GetBestName] to become a better Warrior of the Rising Sun, you will doubtlessly also be able to do more enjoyable things together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_107;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_108;You approached [From.GetBestName] with the suggestion of a more intimate relationship, but though the two of you are close [From.GetBestName] courteously but firmly told you that [From.GetSheHe] does not wish for a intimate relationship and that [From.GetSheHe] thinks it is rather improper for a mentor to have such a relationship with one of [Root.GetHerHis] students.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_108;Well, that happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_109;You and [From.GetBestName] have been working closely together for a while now, and both of you definitely enjoy each other's company. Though you might not always be working as closely together in the future you are still confident that you have made a friend for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give you an ally should you ever find the need for one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_109;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_110;You and [From.GetBestName] have been working closely together for a while now, and both of you definitely enjoy each other's company. Though you might not always be working as closely together in the future you are still confident that you have made a friend for life, and that friendship will doubtlessly give you an ally should you ever find the need for one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_110;We shall stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_111;Personal combat is something that every Warrior of the Rising Sun should be familiar with, but a true Warrior of the Rising Sun is also a good commander, and you and [From.GetBestName] should probably spend some time working on both strategy and tactics while you are mentoring [From.GetHerHim] instead of neglecting it for other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_111;Let's discuss warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_111;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_112;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has let you know that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that it is time for the two of you to work on the subjects of strategy and tactics, as while a Warrior of the Rising Sun that can't fight in personal combat is a poor warrior one that cannot command other warriors on the battlefield is also a poor warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_112;Let's discuss warfare!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_112;I have other plans...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_113;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and though you have seen shirabyoshi performances that have been quite entertaining their outfits, and particularly their swords, have often seemed a bit odd to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_113;Women with swords! How silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_113;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_114;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Apparently [From.GetBestName] has opinions about the fact that shirabyoshi wear those outfits, as [From.GetSheHe] speaks dismissively of their male outfits and the fact that they are wearing swords that, in [From.GetHerHis] opinion, they are not worthy of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_114;They are indeed quite silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_114;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_115;It seems that your student, [From.GetBestName], does not share your opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that you might be wrong about them being wrong to wear their chosen clothing and to carry swords. Apparently, [From.GetSheHe] thinks that they might be more skilled at fighting than most believe, and that they should be treated as respectfully as warriors would be treated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_115;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_116;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and they also wear swords at their side, much like you do. Perhaps they are as worthy of them as you are, since there are those that would dismiss you at a glance as well?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_116;Don't underestimate them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_116;They aren't warriors...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_117;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Your mentor comments on the fact that they wear swords at their side and that there are those that would look down on them as a result, but notes that she also wears a sword and that that should prove that it is unwise to dismiss armed women out of hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_117;They could indeed be good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_117;They are not true warriors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_118;It seems that your student, [From.GetBestName], does not share your opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that they make a mockery of true warriors everywhere and that respecting them is uncalled for, since even though you are a female warrior that does not mean that women are suited to be warriors in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_118;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_119;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and they also wear swords at their side, much like your student. Perhaps you should warn your student that she needs to be diligent to prove herself better than them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_119;Hold them up as a warning;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_119;Let's not be hasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_120;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Your mentor comments on their appearance and the fact that the have swords at their side in a disparaging manner, and also suggests that you will need to work hard to prove yourself better than them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_120;Ignore the insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_120;Speak out;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_121;It seems that your student, [From.GetBestName], does not share your opinion about shirabyoshi, as [From.GetSheHe] angrily says that you should not be so hasty in dismissing either them or her, and also states that women are just as fit at fighting as men are even though they rarely get the opportunity to prove it as they are dismissed out of hand before they can do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_121;Oh, shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_122;One day you and [From.GetBestName] pass by a group of shirabyoshi as you are walking together. They are dressed in their traditional outfit, which of course is something that normally only would be worn by men, and they also wear swords at their side, much like you and your student, and it is certainly not something that should be discouraged as women can be great warriors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_122;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_123;As you and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], are walking together one day you pass by a group of shirabyoshi wearing their traditional outfits. Your mentor comments on the fact that they are wearing swords at their side, much like the two of you are, and states plainly that women should be permitted to wear and wield them if they wish to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_123;We all deserve to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_124;You have been a Warrior of the Rising Sun for quite some time, and though the Warriors of the Rising Sun pride themselves on their honor you have always thought that honor is not quite as important as some others might think at certain times. Perhaps it would be useful to share this insight with your student, [From.GetBestName], so that [From.GetSheHe] does not overvalue honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_124;Honor has its limits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_124;Let's not bring this up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_125;You have always been told that a Warrior of the Rising Sun should act with honor, and you would have thought that this sentiment was shared by your mentor, [From.GetBestName]. However, to your suprise, [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that there are times that honor should be ignored in favor of a more pragmatic solution to a problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_125;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_125;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_126;Your attempt to teach [From.GetBestName] that honor is not always of utmost importance has gone poorly, as [From.GetSheHe] rather firmly has told you that [From.GetSheHe] disagrees with that notion. Though you manage to salvage the situation quickly enough that you don't think that your student will inform others of the conversation, it seems your student won't see things your way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_126;Unfortunate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_127;You and your student, [From.GetBestName], have come to dislike one another quite a bit since you first started mentoring [From.GetHerHim]. You cannot dismiss them out of hand, and you are not prepared to declare them worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun just to get rid of them, but you could suggest a practice duel to first blood with the intention of harming them more grieviously...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_127;I challenge you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_127;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_128;You and your mentor, [From.GetBestName], do not exactly see eye-to-eye, and you suspect that both of you would like nothing more than to be rid of one another. [From.GetSheHeCap] has now suggested a practice duel to first blood, and though it would be unwise to try to kill [From.GetHerHim] you could try to harm [From.GetHerHim] quite a bit, if you accept the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_128;Challenge accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_128;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_129;It seems your student, [From.GetBestName], has no interest in your proposed practice duel. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] saw through your plan to push things as far as you could without actively killing [From.GetHerHim] and elected not to take the risk, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] is just a coward that doesn't deserve as good a teacher as you?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_129;I think it is cowardice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_130;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way you had intended for it to go. In fact, it goes about as poorly as it could go, short of your student killing you, as [From.GetSheHe] easily avoids your sword and quickly inflicts a major wound on you. It seems like it was a bad idea to issue the challenge...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_130;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_131;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes about as well as you had planned. [From.GetSheHeCap] makes a few feeble attempts to wound you that you easily avoid, and you quickly manage to inflict a grievious wound on [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetHerHis] ability to defend [From.GetHerselfHimself] clearly is lacking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_131;You deserve no less!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_132;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way you had intended for it to go.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_132;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_133;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood goes quite well, all things considered. Though it takes a while before it is decided, you manage to block all of [From.GetHerHis] attacks before they can draw blood and eventually manage to get past [From.GetHerHis] defenses to wound [From.GetHerHim], if perhaps not as grieviously as you would have preferred...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_137;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_138;While [From.GetBestName] is a promising student [From.GetSheHe] still has quite far to go before [From.GetSheHe] is ready, as far as you can tell. However, from the way [From.GetSheHe] is acting as of late it seems as if [From.GetSheHe] thinks otherwise, and correcting those assumptions could perhaps drive a wedge between the two of you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_138;I could let them pass...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_138;They're not ready!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_139;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you for what you expect to be routine training session even though you have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] can't teach you anything you don't already know at this point. However, to your great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that your training is at an end and that you truly are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_139;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_140;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you one day and tells you that even though you might have started wondering whether you already are at the point where you have proven yourself worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun your training is not yet complete, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that it might still take quite some time before you are done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_140;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_140;I AM READY!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_141;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that you are intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim]. Though this certainly is not the case, your attempt to convince them otherwise only ends up making things worse, and it soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views you as an enemy of [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_141;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_142;[From.GetBestName] is a most promising student, and as far as you can tell [From.GetSheHe] is skilled enough that nobody would fault you for declaring [From.GetHerHis] training over you could of course also choose to delay things in case you do not wish for [From.GetBestName] to advance further in the ranks of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for the time being.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_142;That would be dishonest...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_142;I will hold them back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_143;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you for what you expect to be routine training session even though you have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] can't teach you anything you don't already know at this point. However, to your great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that your training is at an end and that you truly are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_144;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you one day and tells you that even though you might have started wondering whether you already are at the point where you have proven yourself worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun your training is not yet complete, and [From.GetSheHe] suggests that it might still take quite some time before you are done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_144;I suppose you know best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_144;I AM READY!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_145;It seems [From.GetBestName] has become convinced that you are intentionally holding [From.GetHerHim]. This is of course the case, and your attempt to convince them otherwise only ends up making things worse, and it soon becomes quite clear that [From.GetSheHe] now views you as an enemy of [From.GetHerHis].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_145;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_146;Your student, [From.GetBestName], apparently thinks that [From.GetSheHe] is being held back even though you aren't holding [From.GetHerHim] back, as [From.GetSheHe] has told you as much to your face. Clearly, you will need to tell [From.GetHerHim] the truth, and you will need to do so in a convincing fashion to avoid turning [From.GetHerHim] into an enemy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_146;I can explain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_147;For a while now, you have been suspecting that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding you back and that you perhaps were at the point where you had proven that you are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. However, when you confronted [From.GetBestName] about it, [From.GetSheHe] quickly managed to convince you otherwise, and you now understand you need further training.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_147;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_148;For a while now, you have been suspecting that your mentor, [From.GetBestName], has been holding you back and that you perhaps were at the point where you had proven that you are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun. When you confronted [From.GetBestName] about it [From.GetHerHis] response was highly suspicious, which you feel confirms your suspicion...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_148;You LIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_149;Your attempt to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] is in need of further training did not go as intended, as [From.GetSheHe] took what you said as confirmation that you were holding [From.GetHerHim] back even though you are not. As a consequence of this, [From.GetBestName] now seems to view you as an enemy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_149;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_150;[From.GetBestName]'s training has now reached the point where it would be pointless for both of you to continue it any further, as [From.GetSheHe] definitely is worthy of being a full Warrior of the Rising Sun. It it time to inform [From.GetHerHim] of the good news, and perhaps also time to look for another student if there is anyone in need of a mentor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_150;I can teach you no more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_151;Your mentor, [From.GetBestName], summons you for what you expect to be routine training session even though you have started to believe that [From.GetSheHe] can't teach you anything you don't already know at this point. However, to your great pleasure, [From.GetSheHe] instead declares that your training is at an end and that you truly are worthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_151;I knew it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_152;You and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFrom.GetBestName], and you have sometimes shared lessons as a result of your shared mentor. As a result you have gotten to know each other quite well, and you feel certain that you would be able to count on [From.GetBestName] as a friend and ally if you ever need [From.GetHerHis] assistance, which likely also is true the other way around.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_152;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_153;You and [From.GetBestName] are both students of [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and you have sometimes shared lessons as a result of your shared mentor.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_153;Together we will be unstoppable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_154;You have spent quite some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of you share a mentor and both of you seek to prove yourself worthy of being Warriors of the Rising Sun. As you enjoy each other's company, perhaps it would be possible for the two of you to get involved in a more intimate relationship if that is something that you desire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_154;I should proposition them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_154;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_155;You have spent quite some time in the company of [From.GetBestName] as the two of you share a mentor and both of you seek to prove yourself worthy of being Warriors of the Rising Sun, and you have found [From.GetHerHis] company quite enjoyable. One day, [From.GetBestName] suggests that perhaps the two of you should retire somewhere private to begin a more intimate relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_155;Sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_155;No thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_156;[From.GetBestName] is receptive to your suggestion, and it does not take the two of you long to find somewhere private to engage in lovemaking. Though you probably should be discreet about your relationship to ensure that your mentor does not find out about it, knowing that you have a lover around will likely make things rather more enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_156;I knew this would end well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_157;Though [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous when replying to your suggestion the reply is still negative. While it hopefully will not result in things between the two of you becoming strained, you are still somewhat disappointed to hear that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in a relationship with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_157;Well, that went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_158;You share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of you having several lessons together. Though you initially had hoped that you and your fellow student would get along, it is rather clear to you that that is not to be since [From.GetBestName] is highly competitive and sees you as a rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_158;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_159;You share a mentor with [From.GetBestName] in [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and this has resulted in the three of you having several lessons together.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_159;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_160;As you and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove your worth to [FromFrom.GetBestName] you have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between your official lessons since that might help you advance more quickly. Of late, your sessions have been more frequent, and as far as you can tell they are starting to yield some results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_160;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_161;As you and [From.GetBestName] both are trying to prove your worth to [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] you have sometimes gotten together to spar with one another between your official lessons since that might help you advance more quickly.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_161;We have both learned a few things;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_162;You have spent some time around [From.GetBestName] as the two of you share a mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName], and in your opinion [From.GetSheHe] has always been acting a bit dishonestly. Today you found irrefutable proof that [From.GetSheHe] has been lying to your mentor, which probably is information that [FromFrom.GetBestName] would be quite interested in...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_162;Let's confront them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_162;I will let this slide...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_163;It seems [From.GetBestName] has managed to discover proof that you have not been completely honest in your dealings with your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], as [From.GetSheHe] has confronted you with this information. It is possible that a bribe of some kind might be able to buy [From.GetBestName]'s silence, though that would be dishonorable as well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_163;How about some money?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_163;How about a Favor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_RISINGSUN_163;I'm calling in my Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_RISINGSUN_163;Do your worst!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_164;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing your silence when you confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, as [From.GetBestName] immediately offered to pay you quite a bit of money to make you forget about the matter. It would be a bit dishonorable to accept a bribe, of course, but perhaps it will not become known to anyone else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_164;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_164;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_165;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing your silence when you confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, as [From.GetBestName] immediately offered to grant you a Favor to make you forget about the matter.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_165;We have a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_165;I will not be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_166;You would have thought that the offer of a bribe would have convinced [From.GetBestName] to drop the matter of your little lies to your mentor, but evidently [From.GetSheHe] is a bit too honorable for that to be the case, as [From.GetSheHe] laughed at your offer and immediately went to tell your mentor, possibly even bringing up the matter of the bribe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_166;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_167;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to you. Though it is possible that this evidence could have been fabricated, you know that [FromFrom.GetBestName] is less trustworthy than [From.GetBestName], so this accusation is likely true, and this certainly suggests that one of your students is dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_167;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_168;[From.GetBestName] was evidently interested in securing your silence when you confronted [From.GetHerHim] about [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, as [From.GetBestName] immediately called in the Favor that you owed [From.GetHerHim]. As it would not do to fail to honor the Favor and then try to use the information you have about [From.GetBestName]'s dishonesty againt [From.GetHerHim] you see no other option than to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_168;I suppose that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_169;You initially thought that [From.GetBestName] would offer you some kind of bribe in exchange for your silence on the matter of [From.GetHerHis] dishonesty, but apparently there are some limits to what [From.GetSheHe] is willing to do even though [From.GetSheHe] is dishonorable as [From.GetSheHe] laughed in your face and told you to do your worst.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_169;As you wish!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_170;It seems [From.GetBestName] has come across evidence that [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been lying to you.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_170;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_171;You and [From.GetBestName] have a shared mentor in [FromFrom.GetBestName] and have been given all manner of lessons together. Now both of you have been tasked with reading up on matters of warfare in the Art of War and similar books, and it is quite likely that you would understand things better if you did so together as that would let you discuss things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_176;The duel you and [From.GetBestName] fight to first blood does not go the way you had intended for it to go.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_186;You have faced a good amount of prejudice among the Warriors of the Rising Sun as quite a few of them seem to be of the opinion that you are going to be a disappointment to everyone just because you are a woman. It seems that your fellow student, [From.GetBestName], shares this sentiment, as he has told you as much to your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_186;Ignore the insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_186;I will be your better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_187;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not like being called out on being a poor warrior by virtue of being a woman, as she angrily told you that she will not only prove herself worthy of being one of the Warriors of the Rising Sun but also will prove to everyone that she will be your better, and that you one day will rue the day you made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_187;An empty threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_188;You and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as they do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be. The two of you have come to trust one another as a result, and you now consider each other to be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_188;We shall work together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_189;You and [From.GetBestName] are both women and have both faced quite a bit of prejudice from other Warriors of the Rising Sun as they do not seem to grasp the fact that a woman can be just as good a warrior as a man can be. The two of you have come to trust one another as a result, and you now consider each other to be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_189;We shall work together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_190;One of your friends, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName] in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. You have had a good number of interactions with the two of them recently, and you have discovered that you and [From.GetBestName] have quite a few things in common, and both of you enjoy each other's company. In fact, you would go as far as to name them your friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_190;This will surely be beneficial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_191;[From.GetBestName], a friend of your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and you have spent some time together recently due to your shared obligations as Warriors of the Rising Sun, and you have gotten to know [From.GetHerHim] quite well as a result and definitely enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company, which seems to be a mutual sentiment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_191;I made a new friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_192;You have spent some time in the companty of {FromFrom.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] recently, and it seems as if the two of them are getting along quite well. As [FromFrom.GetBestName] is a close friend of yours, this is likely going to be beneficial for your student in the future, and perhaps also for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_192;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_193;Though there are members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that are quite worthy of the honor of being part of the society there are also members who are unworthy of that honor, such as your rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName]. [FromFrom.GetSheHeCap] is currently educating a new student, [From.GetBestName], and you have grown to dislike [From.GetHerHim] as [From.GetSheHe] clearly is unworthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_193;They are now my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_194;Your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], has made no secret of the fact that [FromFromFrom.GetSheHe] and [From.GetBestName] dislike one another, and while you have been trying to keep an open mind you have realized that [From.GetBestName] clearly does not respect you. It is rather clear that your mentor's rivalry is justified, as some people do not deserve to be part of the WArriors of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_194;They are now my enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_195;You have spoken at length about the dishonorable cretin that is [FromFrom.GetBestName] to your student, [From.GetBestName], and at times it has seemed as if your words have fallen on deaf ears. However, as of today you have learned that your student shares your sentiment about [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] dishonorable character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_195;Good! Good! Destroy them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_196;Your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], is currently mentoring [From.GetBestName] in the ways of the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and from what you have heard [From.GetSheHe] is a quite promising student. Though there are those that would consider it dishonorable to try to steal away someone else's student, perhaps it is justifiable at a time like this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_196;Attempt to recruit them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_196;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_198;One day when you are on the way to meet with your mentor, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], you are approached by [From.GetBestName], who you know is your mentor's rival. [From.GetSheHeCap] suggests that your potential is being squandered by your current mentor and offers to take over the mentoring. While it might be a bit dishonorable to abandon your mentor, perhaps it is worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_198;I pledge myself to you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_198;I will never be your student!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_199;You make your offer to [From.GetBestName] and are quite pleased to discover that [From.GetSheHe] is open to the suggestion that you should take over as [From.GetHerHis] mentor. It brings you even more satisfaction to be present when your new student informs [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] about what happened, as your rival clearly feels humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_199;Just as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_200;Your student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to your lesson, and to your surprise your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], arrives along with your student. You quickly discover that your rival has convinced your student that [From.GetSheHe] would be better off being mentored by [FromFrom.GetHerHim], even though such an offer clearly is dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_200;Curse you both!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_201;You expected [From.GetBestName] to at least give the suggestion that you should become [From.GetHerHis] mentor instead of [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName] some consideration before making up [From.GetHerHis] mind, but [From.GetSheHe] informed you that [From.GetSheHe] was not going to abandon [From.GetHerHis] current mentor in no uncertain terms almost instantly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_201;Well, that didn't work...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_202;Your student, [From.GetBestName], arrives slightly later than expected to your lesson. Inquiring as to the reason for the delay, you learn that [FromFrom.GetBestName], your hated rival, apparently demanded to speak to your student as [From.GetSheHe] was on [From.GetHerHis] way to you and attempted to recruit your student, but that your student turned [FromFrom.GetHerHim] down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_202;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_203;Among the many Novices seeking to prove themselves worthy of progressing further in the Warriors of the Rising Sun is [From.GetBestName], who clearly shows promise. One day the two of you come across one another by pure chance, and you see an opportunity to give [From.GetBestName] some quick advice to help [From.GetHerHim] prove [From.GetHerselfHimself} more easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_203;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_204;You have occasionally come across other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun than your mentor during your training, and though some of them have seen fit to essentially ignore you others have been rather helpful. One of the more helpful people you've met is [From.GetBestName], who recently gave you some advice that hopefully will make it easier for you to prove yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_204;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_205;You have met a good number of Warriors of the Rising Sun over the years, and many of them have been quite dismissive towards you because you are a woman. Doubtlessly, this is something that [From.GetBestName] also will encounter over the years to come, and she would probably have an easier time if she got some early help from those who have been in her position before.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_205;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_206;[From.GetBestName] approaches you one day to express her appreciation of the fact that you have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers you a few quick tips as to how you could deal with the situation and how you could prove yourself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_206;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_207;[FromFrom.GetBestName] and you have both faced prejudice because you are women and many Warriors of the Rising Sun find it hard to accept that you are skilled warriors. Doubtlessly, this is something that [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s student, [From.GetBestName], will have to deal with as well, and she woud probably have an easier time if she got a few tips.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_207;I'll give her some advice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_208;[From.GetBestName] approaches you one day to express her appreciation of the fact that you have joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun despite the fact that many of the men in the society are of the opinion that women should not be members. She offers you a few quick tips as to how you could deal with the situation and how you could prove yourself worthy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_208;My thanks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_209;Your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] has taken a disliking to you, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove to the world that you are unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_209;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_210;Your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals, and the two of them always seek to prove that the other lacks honor. Now it seems that [From.GetBestName] has taken a disliking to you, perhaps because of [From.GetHerHis] mentor's influence, and [From.GetSheHe] seems determined to prove to the world that you are unworthy of being a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_210;You will never be my equal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_211;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals you and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well during your interactions. Though you suspect that your respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of you are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_211;We need not be foes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_212;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals you and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well during your interactions. Though you suspect that your respective mentors would prefer otherwise, the two of you are determined to not get caught up in their dispute and intend to work together in the name of honor and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_213;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are bitter rivals you and [From.GetBestName] have always gotten along quite well during your interactions. [From.GetSheHeCap] seems to thoroughly enjoy your company, and you enjoy [From.GetHerHis] company as well, and perhaps the two of you could take things in a more intimate direction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_213;I will proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_213;It's not worth it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_214;One day you are approached by [From.GetBestName], the student of a rival of your mentor's. The two of you have always gotten along rather well despite your mentors not getting along, and [From.GetSheHe] now suggests that the two of you perhaps should take your current relationship in a more intimate direction regardless of what your mentors would think if they discovered it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_214;That sounds lovely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_214;You and me? Ha!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_215;[From.GetBestName] is quite receptive to your suggestion that the two of you should begin a more intimate relationship, and the two of you quickly find a location where you can have some privacy. Though your mentors doubtlessly would be quite displeased to discover that the two of you now are lovers, hopefully you will be able to avoid discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_215;This turned out well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_216;When approached on the matter [From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] is not interested in a more intimate relationship with you. Perhaps it is because your mentors would find it highly disagreeable if they ever found out, or perhaps [From.GetBestName] simply is not interested in getting a lover. You probably should not take it personally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_216;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_217;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for you and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there's something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for you to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve your friendship, or even your respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_217;You're going down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_218;Though your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends and they presumably would have preferred for you and [From.GetHerHim] to get along there's something infuriating about [From.GetBestName] that makes it impossible for you to stand [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is clearly devoid of honor, and does not deserve your friendship, or even your respect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_218;You're going down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_219;It is no secret that your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of you have also been getting along quite well when you have been spending time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them, and [From.GetSheHe] seems to think the same about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_219;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_220;It is no secret that your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are friends, and the two of you have also been getting along quite well when you have been spending time together. Though there might be Warriors of the Rising Sun that are dishonorable and unworthy, [From.GetBestName] is certainly not one of them, and [From.GetSheHe] seems to think the same about you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_220;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_221;Since your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of you have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and you feel that the two of you are getting along quite well. Maybe the two of you should consider taking your relationship in a more intimate direction?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_221;It is worth a shot...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_221;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_222;Since your mentor and [From.GetBestName]'s mentor are close friends it is only natural that the two of you have been spending quite some time in each other's company, and the two of you have been getting along quite well, which doubtlessly pleases your mentors. One day [From.GetBestName] suggests that the two of you perhaps should take your relationship in a more intimate direction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_222;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_222;Not happening!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_223;[From.GetBestName] is appreciative of your suggestion, and the two of you soon manage to find someplace private to take your relationship to the next level. Though you perhaps should keep your relationship a secret in case others disapprove of it, it will very likely make future meetings between the two of you even more pleasant than the past ones have been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_223;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_224;Thouhg [From.GetBestName] is quite courteous in the way [From.GetSheHe] goes about the matter [From.GetSheHe] still firmly turns down your suggestion that the two of you should consider a more intimate relationship. Perhaps it is for the best, seeing as there might be those that would disapprove of such a relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_224;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_225;You have spoken with other Novices in the Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time during your training to see what they were being taught, occasionally getting small tips from them on things you could do to perhaps prove your worth more quickly. However, you have also been able to give advice at times, such as when you came across [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_225;Here's a quick tip!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_226;It is not uncommon for you to speak with other Novices seeking to prove themselves true Warriors of the Rising Sun from time to time to exchange small bits of advice that might be helpful. Recently, you got a bit of advice from [From.GetBestName] that you think will be quite helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_226;That was helpful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_227;There has always been a small number of women among the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and some of them have been anything but worthy of that honor. Of late, you have considered [From.GetBestName]'s suitability, wondering if she is someone that deserves to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun or not, at it might be dishonest not to tell her if that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_227;She is unworthy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_227;Let's not be too hasty...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_228;It seems that [From.GetBestName] is one of the members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun that is unwilling to accept the fact that a woman could pick up a weapon and wield it just as well as a man as he has told you as much to your face. It is a grave insult, of course, but perhaps you do not want to confront him about it as he perhaps did not mean it the way he said it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_228;Ignore the insult;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_228;I am more worthy than he is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_229;[From.GetBestName] did not take you informing her that she might be unfit to be a Warrior of the Rising Sun well, which perhaps was not all that suprising, and she angrily proclaimed that she was far more worthy of that honor than you ever would be and that you one day would rue the day that you made an enemy of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_229;She's clearly in denial!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_230;Even though you have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time you have encountered quite a few men who have told you that they do not think you should be a warrior. Doubtlessly [From.GetBestName] has experienced similar prejudice, and doubtlessly it would be easier for both of you to face it together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_230;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_231;Even though you have not been a member of the Warriors of the Rising Sun for a very long time you have encountered quite a few men who have told you that they do not think you should be a warrior.

Hopefully, [invited_lodge_soldier.GetSheHe] will serve you and the Warriors of the Rising Sun with honor, so that you in turn may be honored for having [invited_lodge_soldier.GetHerHim] at your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_235;With the death of [From.GetBestName] the invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has been indefinitely postponed.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_240;The promised invasion of the Warriors of the Rising Sun has come.\n\nAt the command of [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetSocietyRank] [rising_sun_grandmaster.GetFirstName], the forces of the Warriors of the Rising Sun depart to attack the [rising_sun_subjugation_defender.GetBestName] in order to secure the [rising_sun_subjugation_target.GetFullName].\n\nIf the Warriors of the Rising Sun are victorious, the member that contributed most to the war will be awarded with the kingdom.

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_247;One day when you and [From.GetBestName], a fellow Warrior of the Rising Sun, are staying at the same inn [From.GetSheHe] sees fit to challenge you to a sake drinking contest.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_247;I don't think this is a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_293;As it has become clear to both you and your opponent that both of you can drink quite a lot of sake and it would be rather foolish to continue any longer you've decided that it is time to end the contest without any further drinks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_294;Instead of taking another drink when it is [From.GetBestName]'s turn [From.GetSheHe] declares that [From.GetSheHe] has had too much to drink already and that [From.GetSheHe] therefore must forfeit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_294;I suppose that means I won...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_295;You take another drink and immediately realize that it was a mistake. Rising unsteadily from the table as you struggle to keep the drinks you've had down you stumble towards the door as quickly as you can, hoping to get outside before it is too late.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_295;Out of the way!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_296;Your opponent takes another drink and then rises unsteadily to [From.GetHerHis] feet, looking quite ill. [From.GetSheHeCap] begins making [From.GetHerHis] way towards the door leading to the outside as quickly as [From.GetSheHe] can, gesturing for people to get out of the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_296;Well, that's that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_300;One day you are approached by [From.GetBestName], a fellow Warrior of the Rising Sun, who suggests that the two of you should engage in a friendly poetry contest. Though poetry is not a particularly useful skill on the battlefield or in a duel, it is still quite respectable for a warrior to compose poetry, and a poetry competition is certainly not something that is unheard of.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_300;I don't think so...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_300;A poetry contesy? Sure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_301;You approach [From.GetBestName] to propose a poetry contest, but though you would have expected [From.GetHerHim] to be interested in such a thing it seems you were mistaken. Perhaps you should try again at a later time, or perhaps you should find someone else to challenge?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_301;I'll think of something else...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_302;With [From.GetBestName] having agreed to a poetry contest with you it is time for you to decide what you want to write about, as you need a plan before you can get started. Doubtlessly your opponent is also considering what [From.GetSheHe] will be writing about already, so there is little time to waste.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_302;I should aim to flatter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_302;I'll write something cruel!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_306;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_306;This went better than expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_307;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_307;This went quite well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_308;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it.

EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_308;It could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_309;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it. You have read your fair share of poems over the years, and even though you are somewhat biased in favor of your own work you have to admit it is not all that good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_309;I did poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_310;You finish up your poem for the poetry contest as the agreed-upon time limit is about to expire and take a moment to read through it. You have read your fair share of poems over the years, and even though you are somewhat biased in favor of your own work you have to admit it is one of the worst poems you've ever seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_310;This is awful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_311;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It describes you and your accomplishments in quite flattering terms, and it is clear that [From.GetBestName] has put a lot of effort into trying to get on your good side with the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_311;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_312;[From.GetBestName] informs you that [From.GetSheHe] found your poem quite impressive and that the words you used to describe [From.GetHerHis] accomplishments certainly were well chosen. It seems you have made a new friend, and a friend among the Warriors of the Rising sun is certainly going to be an advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_312;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_313;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It describes your and your accomplishments in quite unflattering terms, and even though it fills you with anger you reluctantly have to admit that it is not a poor poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_313;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_314;You study [From.GetBestName]'s expression carefully as [From.GetSheHe] reads your poem and can tell that you have done a good job due to [From.GetHerHim] being unable to conceal [From.GetHerHis] anger. As you are not told that the poem was poorly written you also have to conclude that [From.GetBestName] cannot dismiss it based on its quality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_314;Looks like I struck a nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_315;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. The poem makes several insinuations about you and the truth about your acoomplishments, and though you would like nothing better than to claim that it is poorly written you are forced to admit that it is actually a good poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_315;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_316;You can see anger quite clearly on [From.GetBestName]'s face as [From.GetSheHe] takes in what you have written. You initially think that [From.GetSheHe] at least will attempt to claim that it is poorly written or something in an attempt to save face, but when no such claim is made you become confident that [From.GetBestName] has to admit that it is a good poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_316;Looks like I struck a nerve!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_317;You can see [From.GetBestName] studying your face carefully as you read [From.GetHerHis] poem. It is quite well-written, and you say as much when you are finished, which seems to please [From.GetHerHim] greatly. However, for some reason, [From.GetHerHis] smile strikes you as a bit odd...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_317;I must be missing something...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_318;You look at [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] reads your poem to see if [From.GetSheHe] spots the veiled insults in the poem, but given that [From.GetSheHe] does not look the least bit upset and actually compliments you on your poem it appears that [From.GetSheHe] has failed to notice what you actually wrote.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_318;Child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_319;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It describes you in quite flattering terms, and you think you detect a hint that [From.GetBestName] might have an interest to get to know you more intimately, even if there is nothing overt in the poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_319;I should proposition them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_319;I'm not interested in them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_320;It seems your flirtatious poem was quite good in [From.GetBestName]'s opinion, as [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps the two of you should retire somewhere more privately for a while. Of course, just because you flirted with [From.GetHerHim] it certainly does not have to mean that you want things to go any further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_320;Let's find somewhere private!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_320;I don't want to go that far...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_321;Despite attempting to flirt with [From.GetBestName] using your poem it does not appear as if [From.GetSheHe] noticed that that was what you were doing as [From.GetSheHe] does not comment on it as [From.GetSheHe] finishes reading. You were a bit circumspect, of course, but you thought it still was clear enough for [From.GetBestName] to catch on.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_321;Perhaps I was too vague...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_322;[From.GetBestName] is receptive to your suggestion, and though you and [From.GetBestName] do not find someplace private quite as quickly as you would have preferred, but after a while you do manage to find someplace where you can become more intimately acquainted with one another. Hopefully this development will not be something you regret in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_322;That was wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_324;[From.GetBestName] turns down the suggestion that the two of you should retire somewhere more private to get to know each other more intimately. It is possible that what you thought you read was not what [From.GetSheHe] actually meant, or perhaps [From.GetSheHe] had no interest in anything beyond a little flirting in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_324;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_325;The poem that your lover, [From.GetBestName], wrote for you was a love poem, and it was quite flattering. The two of you decide to slip away to somewhere more private for a while before resuming the contest, and neither of you see the need to rush things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_325;That was wonderful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_326;Your lover, [From.GetBestName], is quite receptive of the poem you wrote for [From.GetHerHim], and the two of you quickly decide to slip away to somewhere more private for a while. Neither of you is in a great rush to get back to the poetry contest, so it takes you quite some time before you are ready to return to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_326;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_327;[From.GetBestName] has chosen to write a poem about how to wage war. While perhaps an unusual subject for a poem, the poem you have been given to read is quite good and also manages to give you some ideas you might wish to put to the test on the battlefield in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_327;That was well written!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_328;Your poem about warfare was well received by [From.GetBestName], who tells you that it both has merit as a poem and perhaps could be useful to teach other Warriors of the Rising Sun some things about how they should approach battlefield command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_328;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_329;[From.GetBestName] has written a poem about nature. It is a quite common subject, and you have come across many poems written by poets that do not look further than the obvious cherry blossoms when writing on that subject, but [From.GetBestName] has actually done a good job and paints a very vivid picture with [From.GetHerHis] words.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_329;That was beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_330;You were a bit afraid that your poem about nature would be poorly received because you had elected to not go for a common approach to the subject, but [From.GetBestName] praises your work once [From.GetSheHe] is done reading, telling you that it was a very refreshing take on the subject.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_330;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_331;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is on the subject of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, which is not your faith and normally not a faith you would have much interest in, but [From.GetBestName]'s words are quite beautiful and you get the feeling that perhaps [From.GetHerHis] religion is not as strange as you previously had thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_331;I understand them more now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_332;You considered it a bit daring to write a poem about the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith as [From.GetBestName] follows the [From.Religion.GetName] faith instead, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] was appreciative of it as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that it has made [From.GetHerHim] interested in learning more in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_332;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_333;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is on the subject of the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, which is a proper subject for a poet to choose, and [From.GetSheHe] has written a theologically valid work in your opinion. The poem is also quite excellent when it comes to the word choice, so it has other merits as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_333;That was well written!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_334;As both you and [From.GetBestName] share the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith it was perhaps very safe to write about it, though if you had done a poor job it might have come across as an affront even so. You had nothing to worry about, however, as [From.GetBestName] tells you that the poem is quite good and theologically sound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_334;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_335;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is on the subject of personal combat, specifically with a sword, and personal combat is of course highly regarded by the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Though poems often are quite abstract you feel that the poem you have in your hands is rather more informative as most, and you feel that you perhaps have gained some new insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_335;A fine poem indeed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_336;[From.GetBestName] compliments you on your poem about personal combat, telling you that it is rare for such a poem to be as informative as yours. Given that there are no complaints about the writing itself you are confident that [From.GetBestName] also considers it a good poem based on other merits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_336;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_337;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. Reading it, you notice that it appears to be an attempt to paint you in flattering terms, but [From.GetBestName]'s approach to it leaves something to be desired, and some parts of the poem almost reads as insults instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_337;That wasn't nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_338;You had expected [From.GetBestName] to appreciate your attempt at flattery, but [From.GetSheHe] looks quite displeased when [From.GetSheHe] is done reading and tells you that your poem is borderline insulting in some places but that [From.GetSheHe] will give you the benefit of the doubt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_338;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_339;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. It quickly becomes clear that the poem is supposed to insult you, but the poor quality of the writing and the poor choice of insults almost makes you laugh instead of making you angry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_339;This poem is the true insult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_340;You had hoped that [From.GetBestName] would get insulted by your poem as you wrote it to achieve that, but instead of getting visibly angry [From.GetSheHe] smiles and tells you that making [From.GetHerHim] read such a shoddy work is rather insulting since [From.GetSheHe] had expected you to at least make an effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_340;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_341;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. The poem is a poorly written attempt to slander you, and it is quite clear that [From.GetBestName] both is an unskilled poet and is unable to come up with something truly slanderous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_341;I have been called worse by better!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_342;Your attempt to slander [From.GetBestName] with your poem did not go well, as [From.GetSheHe] tells you that a child would have been more imaginative and likely also would have been a better poet. [From.GetSheHeCap] also muses that it is questionable whether the rest of the Warriors of the Rising Sun will take more offense at the slander than at the poor quality of your work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_342;You dare?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_343;You can see [From.GetBestName] studying your face carefully as you read [From.GetHerHis] poem, and it quickly becomes clear why. Though it appears as if [From.GetBestName] has attempted to be stealthy, [From.GetHerHis] poem rather clearly contains several poorly vailed insults, and it is also poorly written in general.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_343;This was poorly done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_344;You look at [From.GetBestName] as [From.GetSheHe] reads your poem to see if [From.GetSheHe] spots the veiled insults in the poem, and there is no doubt that [From.GetSheHe] has as [From.GetSheHe] tells you as much and also tells you that your poem is poorly written even when you ignore your dishonorable conduct.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_344;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_345;You read through [From.GetBestName]'s poem and immediately notice that it is dedicated to you. Judging by the way [From.GetBestName] describes you in the poem and several rather coarse suggestions it is possible that [From.GetSheHe] has been trying to flirt with you using [From.GetHerHis] poem, but if so the result is almost insulting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_345;That wasn't very nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_346;[From.GetBestName] finishes reading your poem and quickly tells you that [From.GetSheHe] does not appreciate the terms you used to describe [From.GetHerHim]. [From.GetSheHeCap] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] will not take it as an insult, but it is quite evident that your attempt to flirt has failed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_346;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_347;[From.GetBestName] has written a poem about warfare, and though the abstract nature of many poems means it would be fair to not expect too much from the poem you get the distinct feeling that [From.GetBestName] does not understand warfare even half as well as [From.GetSheHe] would be expected to as a Warrior of the Rising Sun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_347;This is all wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_348;[From.GetBestName] swiftly reads your poem about warfare after you hand it to [From.GetHerHim] and immediately tells you that [From.GetSheHe] thinks that you perhaps should have chosen another subject to write about given that the battle you describe sounds very confusing. Perhaps [From.GetSheHe] even thinks that you don't understand warfare, even if [From.GetSheHe] does not say as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_348;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_349;You are not surprised to discover that [From.GetBestName]'s poem is about nature, as it is a very common subject for poets to write about, but you are a bit surprised that [From.GetBestName] has elected to not look very far for inspiration and instead has gone for a rather too common choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_349;Cherry blossoms are overdone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_350;[From.GetBestName] finishes reading your poem and lets out a sigh, telling you that [From.GetSheHe] had hoped that your poem would be a bit more imaginative than just another nature poem about cherry blossoms in the wind. [From.GetSheHeCap] also indicates that the poem might be a bit lacking in other respects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_350;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_351;[From.GetBestName] has written a poem about the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, and you do not like what you are reading. If [From.GetSheHe] wanted to exalt [From.Religion.GetHighGodName] and the righteousness of those that follow the [From.Religion.GetName] faith, [From.GetBestName] should have put in more effort than [From.GetSheHe] actually did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_351;This is wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_352;Your poem about the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is poorly received by [From.GetBestName], who tells you that it certainly is not painting [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] or the [Root.Religion.GetName] faithful in a good light and also tells you that you would have had to put in far more of an effort to write a good poem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_352;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_353;[From.GetBestName]'s poem is about personal combat, and even when you mentally concede that a poem perhaps is not all that good at teaching someone anything about swordfighting you cannot quite shake the feeling that [From.GetBestName] also lacks an understanding of the subject matter that goes beyond how to write a good poem about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_353;That's not right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_354;[From.GetBestName] informs you that your poem sadly is not all that good and indicates that many Warriors of the Rising Sun might get a bit confused about just what you meant by the way you described the swordfighting in the poem. Perhaps [From.GetBestName] even thinks that you don't understand that subject in general, even if [From.GetSheHe] does not say as much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_354;That went poorly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_356;After reading each other's poem and also showing them to a few other parties that you both agreed would be unbiased it has become clear that your poem was the better poem. With that, the contest is concluded, and it is time for you and your opponent to get back to other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_356;That went well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_356;I could easily have lost...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_357;After reading each other's poem and also showing them to a few other parties that you both agreed would be unbiased it has become clear that your poem was the worse one. With that, the contest is concluded, and it is time for you and your opponent to get back to other things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_357;I almost won that...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_357;It wasn't even close...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_359;Your education is, sadly, a bit lacking, and though you have yet to excel as a Warrior of the Rising Sun you have picked up a few useful things related to warfare over the years. Perhaps it would be better to dedicate yourself to that area instead, as it definitely is something that might make people respect you more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_359;I should focus on war instead!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_359;I don't think that would be better...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_360;As part of the Warriors of the Rising Sun it is only natural that you practice with various weapons on a frequent basis, and in addition to making you better at wielding those weapons your training has made you a bit stronger in general, which doubtlessly will be useful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_360;I am stronger than yesterday!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_361;You have been working to improve your skills as a warrior and your skills as a commander quite a bit since you joined the Warriors of the Rising Sun, and though it sometimes can be a bit tedious you are seeing some promising results. You are also starting to see more value in hard work in general than you previusly did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_361;I will work harder!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_362;While less civilized cultures teach their warriors that the correct approach to warfare and personal combat the Warriors of the Rising Sun disagree about that, and you have been working hard to get better at approaching those matters in a slower, more measured way, which is starting to yield results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_362;A warrior's greatest weapon is patience!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_363;The Warriors of the Rising Sun are many, and no matter how skilled any one of them might be you have seen more than a few of them lose duels because they were too proud of their own abilities to consider the fact that their opponents might be skilled as well, and you do not wish to make the same mistake in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_363;I should not think too highly of myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_364;Though there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun that are of the belief that it is of interest for every warrior to be humble enough to consider that they might have more to learn you are quite confident in your abilities and do not really see why you should make a secret of the fact that you are a skilled warrior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_364;I am worthy of praise!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_365;While there are those among the Warriors of the Rising Sun that seem perfectly content with what they have at the moment you are not one of them. As a skilled warrior you are obvously in a position to get more, and aside from making sure that you are acting in an honorable fashion there is little reason not to try to get more than you already have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_365;I deserve all I want!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_366;There are many kinds of warriors, and there are many skills that might be of use for a warrior, but there is little doubt that courage is one of the most important ones. As a Warrior of the Rising Sun, you have been keeping this in mind a lot recently, and you have managed to overcome some of your previous fears as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_366;Fear is for the enemy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_367;While there are those that say that wars are full of deception and that would suggest that a Warrior of the Rising Sun should be prepared to use even the most dishonorable and dishonest tactics to win, you are convinced that those people are wrong. Honor is important, and deceit is dishonorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_367;Honesty is honorable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_368;A Warrior of the Rising Sun is supposed to be honorable, and there is honor in following the law no matter what benefits there might be to not doing so at times. You have been thinking about this quite a bit recently and have also been studying various applicable laws to ensure that you are not disobeying any of them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_368;Being just is honorable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_369;While most Warriors of the Rising Sun are honorable and thus try to avoid deceit, the same can not be said for most people, and of late you have become more and more worried that the people around you that are not Warriors of the Rising Sun might be trying to take advantage of you because they think that you trust that everyone is honorable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_369;I must be on my guard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_370;It is well known that the Warriors of the Rising Sun value honor and honesty, and you consider it equally well known that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonest and dishonorable. As [member_to_discredit_rival_to.GetBestName] does not appear to share your opinion about the latter at this time, perhaps it would be worth trying to convince [member_to_discredit_rival_to.GetHerHim] of your rival's dishonesty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_370;I will give it a try...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_370;This is not worth my time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_371;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. You have long known that the two of them do not like one another, but you had not heard the full story before today, and it is fairly obvious to you that [From.GetBestName] deserves your friendship and [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] deserves nothing short of your enmity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_371;How could I have missed this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_372;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. Despite the fact that it is your rival that has been acting in a dishonorable manner when interacting with you it seems that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] still has managed to convince [From.GetBestName] that [From.GetSheHe] should oppose you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_372;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_373;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and after you finish [From.GetSheHe] is convinced that you are in the right. Though you needed to embellish a few things and perhaps did not mention some minor details concerning your actions, it was probably the right decision to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_373;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_374;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Based on what you are told it is very possible that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and should be regarded as a threat, but as [From.GetBestName] very likely is biased you are not entirely certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_374;Maybe I should keep my guard up...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_375;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. Though it seems that [From.GetBestName] has some reservations [From.GetSheHe] still seems to be at least somewhat convinced that your dishonorable rival is correct about you being dishonorable, even though this obviously is false.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_375;Could have been better...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_376;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and though [From.GetSheHe] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] isn't fully convinced that things are as bad as you say that they are you feel that you still have managed to make [From.GetHerHim] at least somewhat suspicious of your rival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_376;Could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_377;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] has quite a few things to say about [From.GetHerHis] rival, and what [From.GetSheHe] says would certainly be cause for concern if [From.GetSheHe] is speaking truly, but you are unsure whether that is the case.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_377;I'm not sure what to think...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_378;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. You would have expected your arguments to have been convincing, but when you are finished [From.GetBestName] tells you that [From.GetSheHe] is no more convinced than when you started.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_378;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_379;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. Though [From.GetBestName] can point to many things that [From.GetSheHe] thinks proves that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is dishonorable and someone that should be your enemy you feel that what you are being told is somewhat distorted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_379;I think this isn't true...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_380;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. It seems that [From.GetSheHe] was unconvinced, however, and that [From.GetSheHe] now suspects the truth about your rival being the dishonorable party and that you are in the right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_380;That is good to know...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_381;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when you are finished [From.GetSheHe] says that there are parts of what you have said that make no sense. As you had to be a bit creative about how you framed some things, that is perhaps to be expected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_381;Well, that's not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_382;[From.GetBestName] approached you today to discuss the matter of [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName]. As far as you can tell, [From.GetSheHe] is blowing things massively out of proportion and [From.GetHerHis] own actions seem rather dishonest when you consider them. Evidently, things are not as [From.GetSheHe] says they are.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_382;It is the other way around!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_383;You have learned that your hated rival, [FromFrom.GetBestName], has spoken to [From.GetBestName] about you and your actions. Luckily for you, your rival failed to make [FromFrom.GetHerHis] lies convincing, and [From.GetBestName] now considers you a friend and your rival someone that should be [From.GetHerHis] enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_383;That's great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_384;[From.GetBestName] listens carefully to what you have to say about [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName], and when you are done [From.GetSheHe] tells you that what you have said has convinced [From.GetHerHim] that you are the dishonorable party and that [rival_to_discredit.GetBestName] is in the right. It seems you have gained a new enemy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_384;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_385;It is not uncommon for small numbers of Warriors of the Rising Sun to get together to discuss military matters with one another, and today you attended such a meeting. Based on waht happened there, it was time well spent, and you look forward to the next such meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_385;I learned some new things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_RISINGSUN_385;My input was appreciated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_RISINGSUN_387;Today you took part in a discussion about the advancement of military knowledge with other members of the Warriors of the Rising Sun. Though it of course is important to preserve various old and honorable traditions, it is still good to see what can be improved, and you learned a number of things today.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_RISINGSUN_387;A valuable discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
