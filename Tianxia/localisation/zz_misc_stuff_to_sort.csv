EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_209;"It is curious, don't you think, that the color yellow is associated with the Dragon Throne," the whispering voice of Sanity's Demise unexpectedly says in your mind.

EVTDESCM_ARTIFACTS_209;"Build a temple," the dagger known as Sanity's demise suddenly says, speaking directly into your mind. "Build a temple, and put a bell in it, adorned with great horns. Ring it thirteen times, and the truth as to what lies beneath your cities shall be revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCN_ARTIFACTS_209;"Good and Evil," you hear the voice of Sanity's Demise suddenly whisper in your mind. "Order and Chaos. Blue and Orange." The voice laughs for quite a while before continuing. "Your human notions when it comes to morality are so... quaint.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCO_ARTIFACTS_209;"If you knew more than the merest fraction of what I know, you would go mad," Sanity's Demise proclaims in your mind in the middle of the night, causing you to come awake.

EVTDESCP_ARTIFACTS_209;"Listen to the voices from beyond the stars," the wicked dagger known as Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "They know the truth. They know all the truths." The dagger lets out a wicked laugh. "You will see, one day soon, when everything is revealed!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCQ_ARTIFACTS_209;"Have you heard of the Outer Gates?" Sanity's Demise suddenly asks in your mind, continuing before you have the chance to attempt to respond to the question. "There are those that would seek to prevent you from questing beyond them, but they lack the vision to see the truth!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCR_ARTIFACTS_209;"Shall I tell you what the future holds?" the voice of Sanity's Demise whispers to you. "It will be grim and dark, you see. The stars shall know no peace, and the laughter of gods shall echo among them. An eternity of slaughter awaits you, as there shall be only war!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCS_ARTIFACTS_209;"That is not dead which can eternal lie, and with strange aeons even death may die," Sanity's Demise tells you, speaking into your mind. "There are things in this world you cannot possibly know, not if you wish to keep your mind whole. Of course, that would hold you back...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCT_ARTIFACTS_209;"Six are the stones, but only two are nearby," Sanity's Demise tells you one day after you have visited a small shrine. "Space is in the church. Time is in the Sanctum. Find them, and use them to find the Soul, the Mind, Reality, and Power. Once that is done, snap your fingers and all shall be as you desire!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCU_ARTIFACTS_209;"The Black Pharaoh's reign ended long ago, but he seeks his throne once more," Sanity's Demise's voice whispers.

EVTDESCV_ARTIFACTS_209;"There are powers that would see fit to ask for the blood of a virgin, or a child, or a holy person," Sanity's Demise whispers into your mind. "In truth, any human's blood would suffice. I can show you, if you will only let me! I'm sure you won't regret it...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCX_ARTIFACTS_209;"With the defeat of Fredak, the Emperor of Embers, you must think that this world is capable of defeating any dragon," Sanity's Demise tells you, one day.

EVTDESCY_ARTIFACTS_209;"Beneath the surface of this world you can find many truths," Sanity's Demise tells you. "There are cities there, you know, that belong to those that once ruled this world. Their empires have crubled, but they remain. You should dig for answers!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESCA_ARTIFACTS_210;You are inspecting a recently constructed building in [Root.Location.GetName] when you hear the Living Flame speak to you, even though you have not seen fit to bring it with you.\n\n"IT IS SO FLAMMABLE," it tells you. "BURN IT! BURN IT TO THE GROUND!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_ARTIFACTS_210;You are having trouble sleeping one night and decide to go for a walk in [Root.Location.GetName]. A short while after you set off the voice of the Living Flame speaks in your mind.\n\n"THIS NIGHT IS DARK, BUT IT COULD BE SO MUCH BRIGHTER!" it says. "START A BONFIRE!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_ARTIFACTS_210;The Living Flame suddenly speaks in your mind one day when you are taking a break from the affairs of the day.\n\n"THIS WORLD, AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE, CAN BURN!" it tells you. "YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH, HUMAN, AND YOU KNOW OF SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BURN!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_ARTIFACTS_210;"THIS DAY IS BRIGHT, BUT IT COULD BE EVEN BRIGHTER!" the voice of the Living Flame suddenly says in your mind, catching you by surprise. "GO OUTSIDE! FIND SOMETHING TO BURN! SHOW THE WORLD A SMALL TASTE OF MY POWER!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_ARTIFACTS_210;There are some buildings in [Root.Location.GetName] that are beautiful to look at, but others are not particularly nice to behold.

EVTDESCF_ARTIFACTS_210;"FIRE!" the voice of the Living Flame says in your mind. "A GREAT FIRE IS WHAT THIS PLACE NEEDS!"

While it doubtlessly would be an unpopular to honor this promise, reneging on it would likely also be unpopular as it would show that you are untrustworthy, and reneging would doubtlessly also upset [liao_emperor.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_KHITAN_4;As previously agreed [From.GetBestName] has transferred control of the Sixteen Prefectures to you. The messenger who brought you the news informs you that [From.GetBestName] would like formal acknowledgement of your friendship in the form of a non-aggression pact, as that was discussed at the time when the original agreement was made. Of course, whether it still would be of benefit is hard to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_6;I need to prepare my defenses...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_7;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName]. At first you think that the messenger is bringing news that the Sixteen Prefectures will be turned over as previously agreed, but instead the messenger informs you that [From.GetBestName] does not intend to cede any Chinese land to barbarians and that you should withdraw from China immediately. It would seem [From.GetBestName] has altered the deal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_KHITAN_8;Word has arrived that [From.GetBestName] is invading [FromFrom.GetBestName]'s lands, supposedly in response to [From.GetBestName] reneging on a deal to hand over the Sixteen Prefectures. While there are those that would say that it would have been wrong to honor a deal to hand over Chinese land, others would say that anyone who would claim the Dragon Throne should honor even the worst of deals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_8;I will not oppose this invasion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_8;All of China must fight this threat!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_9;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName], promising reinforcements to assist you against [FromFrom.GetBestName]. It would seem that you are not going to have to face the Khitan menace on your own, as there are those that agree that you were in the right when you decided not to turn over the Sixteen Prefectures as previously agreed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_9;We stand together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_10;Though the recent war ended in defeat it is possible that you still can secure the Sixteen Prefectures as [tang_emperor.GetBestName] probably would want to secure [tang_emperor.GetHerHis] northern border. A non-aggression pact might not be too steep a price to pay, and if it is refused then at least you can truthfully say that you tried the diplomatic approach.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_10;I will send a messenger!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_10;This is a waste of time...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_11;A messenger has arrived from [From.GetBestName] with a somewhat tempting offer that would secure the northern border, at least in the near future. All you would have to give in return is a non-aggression pledge of your own, and the Sixteen Prefectures. The latter might not be to everyone's liking, though maybe it is still worth it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_11;I will cede the Sixteen Prefectures!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_11;I will not cede Chinese land!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_12;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that your proposal was agreeable, and the Sixteen Prefectures have been transferred to you.

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_12;This was a mutually beneficial agreement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_13;[From.GetBestName] has seen fit to transfer your holdings in the Sixteen Prefectures to [liao_emperor.GetBestName].

EVTOPTA_KHITAN_13;[From.GetSheHeCap] is unfit to rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_14;The messenger you sent to [From.GetBestName] has returned with word that your proposal was not agreeable and that [From.GetBestName] is not open to ceding the Sixteen Prefectures regardless of what you might offer in return for them. While not what you wanted to hear, it is likely that the fact that you lost the recent war influenced the decision.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_KHITAN_14;I am not surprised...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_KHITAN_14;The Sixteen Prefectures should be mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_KHITAN_15;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] has seen fit to claim the Sixteen Prefectures, seemingly not content with being told that they are rightfully part of your realm.
