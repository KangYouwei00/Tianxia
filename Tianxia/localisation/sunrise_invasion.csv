# Sunrise Invasion
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_2;Lost at Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_2;A Chinese merchant by the name of Ma He recently left Guangzhou with a large fleet of ships, sailing in the direction of the Tagalog Archipelago on what should have been a fairly ordinary voyage, but he did not arrive roughly when it would have been expected, and it is unclear where he has ended up.\n\nA few sailors aboard other ships in the area claim to have seen a large number of ship heading east, where they claim that a storm was brewing, but it is quite possible that they are making things up in the hopes of having someone buy them an extra drink or three.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_2;These things happen...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_4;The Burning Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_4;Word has reached you that a small ship with a half-starved crew made landfall in the eastern reaches of Java recently. The sailors aboard claim to have been part of Ma He's fleet, which apparently sailed east for several months if they are to be believed.\n\nFurthermore, the sailors claim that they alone remain from the fleet that left Guangzhou, as the fleet supposedly encountered a realm they refer to as the "Burning Empire". This realm's ruler, the "Lord of the Dawn", supposedly captured Ma He's fleet shortly after it made landfall on an undiscovered continent, and barely anyone escaped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_4;They have clearly gone mad!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_6;Trouble in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_6;The great archipelago east of Java is known to be home to many savage tribes that have little to offer to the civilized people found elsewhere, and thus it is an area that it rarely is worth paying attention to, and that's even more rarely worth visiting.\n\nRecently, word has been arriving from the eastern archipelago that a great tribe of warriors in enormous ships have started attacking the people there, and many tribes that formerly were considered regional powers have supposedly been conquered already. Where these invaders came from is somewhat unclear, though some whisper that they came across the eastern sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_6;Surely this is an exaggeration...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_8;Today a small ship arrived from the eastern archipelago, bringing with it an emissary that supposedly has been given the right to negotiate on behalf of a group of refugees. Apparently, they wish to settle in [papuan_refugee_province.GetName] as their homeland supposedly was conquered by the strangers from the east.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_8;I suppose I can allow it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_8;There is no place for you here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_9;The emissary is not pleased when you refuse his request, and as he boards his ship he loudly proclaims that he and his people will return and will take [papuan_refugee_province.GetName] by force if they have to. The people in the harbour that overhear this seem quite amused by the man's threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_9;Empty threats!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_11;Having been refused land previously, a small band of warriors from the eastern archipelago arrived on the shores of [papuan_refugee_province.GetName] today, clearly intent on taking what they want by force if it cannot be secured through diplomatic means.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_11;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_12;Today a small ship bearing what passes for notables from among the people living in the eastern archipelago arrived at your court. They humbly request permission to stay, as their homeland apparently has fallen and all the other tribes closer to home are in danger of falling as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_12;You can stay in my court!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_12;You cannot stay here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_13;Strangers with Silver;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_13;Several strange ships have been making landfall in Japan and in various islands further south, carrying with them official-looking strangers escorted by large numbers of warriors that have come ashore demanding to speak to the local authorities.\n\nWhen you granted an audience to some of these men, they requested permission for them and some of their countrymen to settle in [province_being_bought.GetName] in the future, offering a substantial payment of silver in return. When asked how many settlers they would be bringing, the men claimed that you hardly need to concern yourself with such details.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_13;I can set aside some land for you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_13;My land is not for sale!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_15;The strange ships have departed, sailing south and east. The envoys did not look pleased when they departed, and some of the people that were nearby claim to have heard some of the strangers say something about the region having to be left to the "Army of the Light", whatever that is supposed to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_15;I have a bad feeling about this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_16;The strange ships have departed, sailing south and east. The envoys looked rather pleased when they departed, and some of the people that were nearby claim to have heard some of the strangers say something about how the region would not need the attention of the "Army of the Light", whatever that is supposed to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_16;I wonder what they meant...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_18;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_18;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_19;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_19;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it, which made landfall shortly after dawn while letting out ululating battle cries.\n\nThough the invaders have proven unwilling to negotiate at this point, some of the refugees fleeing before their advance claim that they have proclaimed that they have been tasked with securing the entirety of what they have termed the "Sunset Isles" for their ruler, and unless they are stopped it is likely that their advance will continue even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_19;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_20;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_20;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_21;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_21;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it, along with priests and priestesses sworn to their heathen god Inti, whose followers supposedly never have been defeated in war.\n\nMany of those who have fled before the invaders claim that their priestesses steal away the daughters of those that submit, and that those daughters either are wedded off to foreign lords or sacrificed to the merciless god, supposedly for the benefit of the whole of their empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_21;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_22;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_22;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_23;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_23;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it. These warriors have been heard letting out ululating cries and are dressed in strange armor made of painted wood and chequered cloth.\n\nThough the battle still rages, some of those fleeing from the invaders claim that they demand that all adopt their strange customs and their heathen religion, and that the people of the towns that refuse are put to death so that the area can be repopulated with Quechua settlers...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_23;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_25;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_25;Knowing of the mightly armies and immense fleets brought to bear by the Incan invaders further south, the rulers of various islands to the north of the Tagalog archipelago have been doing what they can to prepare themselves for a similar onslaught, but it has become clear that they will face a different threat.\n\nInstead of a single mighty host carried by one grand armada, several smaller armies of Inca warriors have made landfall, each of them seemingly operating independently. Those that have managed to flee before the onslaight claim that the invaders have come to claim what they previously purchased, in the name of Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_25;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_26;Hundreds of menacing ships have arrived off the shores of [Root.GetName], spilling out numberless hordes of fierce warriors in strange garb. Their ululating battle cries can be heard for miles!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_26;Throw them back into the sea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_27;Sunrise Invasion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_27;A mighty fleet consisting of hundreds of warships have arrived off the shores of [From.GetName], bringing one of the seemingly inexhaustable armies of the Sapa Inca with it, and disproving the claims made by those those that thought that the invaders would not seek to make landfall so far north.\n\nThere is a lot of confusion at the moment, but according to some of the refugees fleeing before the invaders they bring priests and common craftsmen on their ships in addition to their strangely armed and armored warriors, which indicates that they plan to stay in the region for a long time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_27;They must be driven back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_28;The Inca Meet With Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_28;The great Inca warhost that crossed the ocean in their mad bid to conquer all of Creation has been thrown back into the sea. Their colonies have been lost and their armies vanquished. The pitiful remnants of their invasion force has set sail back towards their homeland of Kay Pacha to lick their wounds and inform the Sapa Inca of their defeat.\n\nThere may come a time when their own shores are visited by fleets from the Old World, and when that happens the debt they have incurred with their former victims will no doubt be collected in full... with interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_28;A reckoning will not be postponed indefinitely!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_30;The Emperor's New Clothes;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_30;The Inca invaders have come into contact with many things that were unfamiliar to them prior to their arrival since they arrived in Asia, and though some of the things they have become fascinated with would be rather mundane as far as the locals would be concerned a few of the things the invaders have taken a liking to are not qutie as mundane.\n\nOne such thing they have taken a liking to is silk, which they have seen fit to ship back vast quantities of to their homeland so that the tailors of Cuzco can make good use of it when creating clothes for the Sapa Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_30;At least the savage isn't naked...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_30;Their efforts are adequate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_31;The Drink of an Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_31;Though they were hesitant to try it at first, the Inca invaders have acquired a taste for tea since their arrival in Asia, and rumour has it vast tea plantations are being constructed back in their distant homeland to ensure that it always will be available for the children of Inti.\n\nIt is said that the Sapa Inca [Root.GetHerselfHimself] likes to hold elaborate tea ceremonies unlike any seen before when hosting [Root.GetHerHis] favorite courtiers, and that [Root.GetHerHis] most trusted generals often drink copious amounts of tea whenever they discuss the process of forging a lasting empire where the sun never sets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_31;An empire where the sun never sets? How silly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_31;Rule, Tawantinsuyu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_32;The Fall of the Great Jungle;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_32;Thanks to the wars they have waged in what they have named the "Sunset Archipelago", the Inca armies have become quite accustomed to jungles. There is precious little information from overseas, but from what can be pieced together it seems the Inca have used their new cavalry regiments to great effect in finally pacifying their stubborn rivals in the eastern jungle.\n\nThe Tupi Alliance and the Muisca Confedertion have already been incorporated into their growing empire, and Cuzco armies are now marching towards the last hold-outs of the Free Lokono City-States on the distant coast. It may only be a matter of time before the entire continent is ruled from the great imperial city of Cuzco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_32;The same must never happen here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_32;Resistance is futile!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_33;The Sun's Fury;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_33;The Inca have been fascinated with fireworks ever since the first time they encountered them, and their interest in them has often bordered on an obseession as several of their armies have had standing orders to secure as many as they can during their campaigns.\n\nRumour has it the invaders have been shipping captured fireworks back to their homeland on a frequent basis, and that they no longer use them to entertain the Sapa Inca and the people of Cuzco. Just what they are being used for is unclear, though some truly outlandish tales claim that they will be used to make Inti's enemies feel his fury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_33;As if that will work!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_33;The power of the sun... in the palm of my hand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_SUNRISE_34;News From Across the Sea;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_34;;Rumours have reached Asia of a titanic struggle taking place across the Great Sea in the homeland of the Inca. The Inca themselves rarely discuss it with outsiders, but it appears they have been locked in a deadly war for some time with the Mexica, a great empire from the jungles far to the north of Cuzco. They are ruled by the Huehuetlatoani, who has allegedly sacrificed untold numbers of people to their blood gods.\n\nIf the stories are to be believed, the warriors of the Aztec managed to inflict a crushing defeat on the Sapa Inca's forces through the use of mounted warriors, and the armies of Inti were forced to withdraw further south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_34;These "Blood-Gods" apparently got plenty of blood...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_34;Mexica was merely a setback!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_35;The Inca armies have secured control over the massive temple of Borobudur, and reports are claiming that the priests of Inti already are making preliminary plans to consecrate it in his name, having declared it one of the holiest sites in the region they have named the "Sunset Archipelago".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_35;They must be stopped!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_35;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_36;The armies of the Sapa Inca now control the entirety of Java, from the Sunda Strait to the Bali Strait, as well as various smaller islands further east. Having determined that the island easily could house a vast population, the invaders have requested that additional settlers be diverted to the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_36;We cannot allow a permanent settlement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_36;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_37;The coastline of the island of Borneo now belongs to the Inca Empire. Several of the jungle tribes deeper inland still resist the invaders, but word is the invaders are not overly eager to defeat them permanently, seeing the minor skirmishes in the region as an opportunity for young warriors to prove themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_37;Perhaps this will be their undoing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_37;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_38;The cruel Inca invaders are now fully in control of the Tagalog archipelago, and rumour has it they both are fortifying the region and are constructing new settlements to house settlers from their homeland, while the priests of Inti supposedly stalk the land to steal away the daughters of the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_38;These brutes must be driven out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_38;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_39;Palembang, once the crown jewel of the Srivijayan Empire, has fallen to the Sapa Inca's hordes. Already work is being carried out to secure the invaders' hold over the city and to throw back any counterattack, and word has it that the many temples of the city are being re-consecrated in the name of Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_39;The city must be liberated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_39;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_40;The Sapa Inca's armies have secured the entirety of Sumatra, along with several smaller islands nearby. Reports claim that they already have had to suppress several small uprisings as some of the rural communities in the region have been even less willing than most to hand over their daughters be indoctrinated by the invaders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_40;Another major loss to the invaders...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_40;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_41;The Inca have now taken over the entirety of the Ryukyuan Archipelago, and express great disdain for their 'Three Mountains', which they say pale in comparison to their homeland. They have begun constructing a grand harbour, where every day more and more ships arrive carrying eager warriors seeking to join the invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_41;What will it take to stop them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_41;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_42;Ise now belongs to the Inca Empire, bringing the grand shrine sacred to Amaterasu under their control. The Inca have expressed disdain for the great kami, claiming that she at best is fit to be a consort of Inti, and reports have it that they might be forcing young women formerly serving Amaterasu to instead pledge themselves to Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_42;They truly have no honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_42;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_43;From the Tsugaru Strait in the north to Tane in the south, Japan is under the Inca yoke. The invaders have found it highly offensive that an area on the western shores of the "Great Western Ocean" is called the "Land of the Rising Sun", and have decreed that the islands must be referred to as the "Land of the Setting Sun".
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_43;May their sun set next!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_43;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_44;The Korean Peninsula now belongs to Inti, and reports from the area claim that many Quechua settlers soon will arrive in the area. Though not adverse to using poetic names for a region, the Sapa Inca's officials have seen fit to adapt the traditional name for the region and refer to it as the "Land of the Evening Calm".;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_44;May it be anything but calm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_44;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_45;The great city of Angkor is now in the hands of the Sapa Inca, and the great temple complex nearby has also fallen. The priests and priestesses of Inti have already begun preparations to sanctify it to their god, declaring their intention to make it into one of the holiest places outside their distant homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_45;This must not be allowed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_45;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_46;From Arakan to Champa, the land now belongs to the Inca Empire. The officials of the Sapa Inca have ordered the locals to provide workers for extensive construction projects, and the ululating warriors from across the sea have proven quite willing to force compliance whenever someone has seen fit to put up resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_46;They cannot be allowed to remain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_46;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_47;The Middle Kingdom's heartland has fallen to the warriors of Inti, perhaps signifying that the Sun God has granted them the Mandate of Heaven. The invaders appear to have found many historical texts from the region highly educational, and it is said that their generals have taken a particular interest in the Art of War.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_47;That cannot possibly bode well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_47;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_48;The Tibetan Plateau now belongs to the Sapa Inca and Inti. The invaders have expressed great interest in the region, finding it somewhat comparable to their homeland, and plans are being made to construct many temples to Inti on the mountains in the area, which the invaders seem to think are taller than those at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_48;We must force them back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_SUNRISE_48;Glory to Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SUNRISE_49;The entirety of India has fallen to the invaders from beyond te sea, who seem undeterred even in the face of war elephants. Having heard tales of how Alexander the Great turned back shortly after crossing the Indus, the invaders have made a sacred vow not to stop and to truly continue until there is no land left to conquer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_SUNRISE_49;When will it end?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Though these "Children of the Light" have yet to prove themselves, it is likely that it is only a matter of time before the order is a large enough force that any who would oppose the Yupaychaspa faith cannot afford to not take them into account.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_6;Not my little [child_to_seize.GetFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_6;Her existing betrothal will have to be broken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ACLLA_6_TOOLTIP;You are given some time to say goodbye to your daughter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_11;An Apupanaca has come all the way from the imperial city of Cuzco, with the sorrowful message that your house has yet to provide a girl to the sacred Acllahuasi. He is here to collect [child_to_seize.GetFirstName].\n\n[apupanaca.GetBestName] explains that she will be taken to a convent in Cuzco, and there instructed in the Incan ways. It is a holy place, and [child_to_seize.GetFirstName] might even receive the honour of being sacrificed to Inti when she reaches adulthood. She could also be married to the Sapa Inca, or one of his vassals.\n\nIt is a great honor, and you would be foolish to refuse, and a traitor at that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_11;I would never disobey the Sapa Inca's request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_11;Her existing betrothal will have to be broken...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_11;You are not taking her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_11_TOOLTIP;This may have serious repercussions...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_12;The Apupanaca had left in a hurry, spouting curses upon your house and your cows. Some of those appear to have come true, as you have now been declared an outlaw in the whole Inca realm! The Sapa Inca can imprison you at will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_12;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_13;Tears keep streaming down [child_to_seize.GetFirstName]'s face, no matter how long you or the Apupanaca keep explaining her new status. In the end you give up and pull her in for a long hug, and a few words whispered in her ear where the emissary cannot hear them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_13;Be strong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_13;Do it for Inti!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_13;I *will* come and get you back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ACLLA_13_GET_BACK_DAUGHTER;You will look for opportunities to retrieve [child_to_seize.GetFirstName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ACLLA_19;It seems [From.GetBestName] is far more set in her [From.Religion.GetName] ways than most, as she keeps refusing to learn how best to serve the Sapa Inca and Inti and claim that [From.Religin.GetHighGodName] will strike you and all other Yupaychaspa faithful down sooner or later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_19;She must learn on her own...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_19;I will talk to her about it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_19;If she will not serve, she will die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_20;Word has reached you that [FromFrom.GetBestName], your [FromFrom.GetRelation], has been executed by [From.GetBestName] due to her unwillingness to serve the Sapa Inca and Inti and her continued claims that the Yupaychaspa faith is a false faith worshipped by heathen savages.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_20;The savages will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_20;She will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_20;She did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_28;Your [aclla_to_rescue.GetRelation], [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName], is living in distant Cuzco with the other Aclla, serving Inti and all the Yupaychaspa faithful. She is without a doubt guarded, but you believe that you might be able to avoid or deal with the guards, and thus it might be a good idea to mount a rescue attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_28;I must leave at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_28;I can't do this now...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_28;I don't really want her back...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_29;You have arrived outside the sacred Acllahuasi. Without doubt, [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] can be found somewhere inside, but in order to reach her you need to get past the guards you can see patrolling outside, as they doubtlessly have orders to keep most people out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_29;I will fight my way past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_29;They can surely be bribed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_29;I can sneak inside!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ACLLA_29;I think I will head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_30;You have returned home from Cuzco, having failed to rescue [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] from the Acllahuasi. It is possible that you will find another opportunity to do so at some point in the future, but it might also not be possible to do so as the Aclla are heavily guarded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_30;We will have to see what the future holds...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_31;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are taken by surprise by your attack, and many of them fall before they can even attempt to defend themselves. The rest do their best to fight back, but they are no match for a [Root.GetManWoman] like you, and before long they all have fallen before you. The way ahead is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_31;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_32;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are taken by surprise by your attack, and many of them fall before they can even attempt to defend themselves.

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_32;I have to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_33;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are taken by surprise by your attack, and a couple of them fall before they can even attempt to defend themselves.

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_34;I have to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_35;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are not particularly surprised by your attack, and they quickly inflict several wounds on you. Eventually you manage to cut the last of them down, but you have taken a grievous wound in the process. At least the way ahead is clear...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_36;I have to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_37;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are not particularly surprised by your attack, and they fight you to a stalemate easily enough. As you are considering various ways to possibly overpower them one of them sneaks up behind you and throws his arms around you, and the rest of them quickly pile on and bring you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_37;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_38;You have just learned that [From.GetBestName] sought to enter the sacred Acllahuasi to steal back [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] but that the guards managed to capture [From.GetHerHim] and have dragged [From.GetHerHim] to a cell, where [From.GetSheHe] will remain until you see fit to release [From.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_38;[From.GetSheHeCap] deserves no less...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_38;Time to make an example!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_39;A short time after being imprisoned [From.GetBestName] arrives outside your cell accompanied by several guards and [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName], your [aclla_to_rescue.GetRelation]. [From.GetBestName] declares that your sacrilege must be punished before swiftly cutting the throat of [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_39;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_40;The guards outside the Acllahuasi are not particularly surprised by your attack, and you take several wounds almost as soon as the fight begins. Though you do your best to fight on, the wounds keep adding up, and several of them are quite bad. It is not long before you are lying on the ground, your vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_40;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_41;You make your presence known to the commander of the guards outside the Acllahuasi and quickly suggest that it would be in his interests to let you slip past them. You know that the guards have sworn sacred vows to keep the Acllahuasi safe, and the man is a bit hesitant, but once you produce a bag of gold he agrees to not interfere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_41;So much for their sacred vows...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_42;You make your presence known to the commander of the guards outside the Acllahuasi and quickly suggest that it would be in his interests to let you slip past them. Unfortunately, the man seems to be determined to keep his sacred vow to keep the Acllahuasi safe, and he tells you to leave before he has to arrest or kill you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_42;I will fight my way past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_42;I will return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_43;You make your presence known to the commander of the guards outside the Acllahuasi and quickly suggest that it would be in his interests to let you slip past them. Unfortunately, the man seems to be determined to keep his sacred vow to keep the Acllahuasi safe, and he orders you to surrender to face Inti's justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_43;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_43;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_44;You circle around the Acllahuasi and discover what appears to be an unguarded back entrance. You spend some time investigating it to make sure that it is not a trap, before carefully moving closer and making your way inside. You do not encounter any guards inside either, and can progress with your search.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_44;The guards must be lazy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_45;You circle around the Acllahuasi and discover what appears to be an unguarded back entrance. You spend some time investigating it to make sure that it is not a trap, and notice a guard patrol approaching your location. They do not appear to have spotted you yet, but it is only a matter of time before they do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_45;I will fight my way past them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_45;I will return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_46;You circle around the Acllahuasi and discover what appears to be an unguarded back entrance.

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_46;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_46;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_48;As you search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] you hear a voice call out for the guards. Having dealt with the guards previously, none arrive, and you discover that the person that cried out for them was [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName], who seems quite surprised when you find her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_48;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_48;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_49;As you search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] you hear a voice call out for the guards. You are able to discover that it was [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName] that cried out just before a large number of guards arrive, weapons at the ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_49;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_49;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_50;The guards arrive ready to fight, but they were not prepared to face a [Root.GetManWoman] as skilled as you, and you cut them down easily enough. [aclla_rescue_attempt_snitch.GetBestName] is still nearby. She seems quite surprised that you won, and now you must decide how to deal with her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_50;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_50;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_51;The guards arrive ready to fight, but though they are able to wound you in the fighting they ultimately prove unable to stop you, and you cut them all down.

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_52;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_52;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_53;The guards arrive ready to fight, though you fight hard there are many of them. Eventually one of them manages to disarm you, and the others quickly pile on, and they soon have you tied up, ready to be transported to a cell beneath the Acllahuasi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_53;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_54;The guards are ready to fight, and you take several wounds almost as soon as the fight begins. Though you do your best to fight on, the wounds keep adding up, and several of them are quite bad. It is not long before you are lying on the ground, your vision darkening.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_54;And so it ends...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_55;As you search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] you come across [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName], a most attractive Aclla that is seemingly all by herself. As an Aclla, she is supposed to remain a virgin until she leaves the Acllahuasi, but perhaps you can convince her to forsake those vows?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_55;I have time for a detour...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_55;I must remain focused...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_56;It turns out [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] indeed is quite receptive to the idea of forsaking her vows, and the two of you spend some rather enjoyable time together. As you are getting dressed again she asks to come with you, stating that she does not belong in the Acllahuasi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_56;Come with me if you want to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_56;I can't take you with me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_56;You are a loose end to clear up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_57;[From.GetBestName] has informed you that [From.GetSheHe] is unwilling to take you with [From.GetHerHim] despite the fact that [From.GetSheHe] clearly does not respect the vows of the Aclla, as evident from the fact that [From.GetSheHe] was willing to sleep with you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_57;It is probably for the best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_57;"Hell hath no fury...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_58;Mere moments after you inform [From.GetBestName] that you have no intention of taking her with you she calls out for the guards. Since you have dealt with them already none appear, and you now have to decide how to deal with a rather surprised, if still scorned, young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_58;Go away, and stay away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_58;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_59;Mere moments after you inform [From.GetBestName] that you have no intention of taking her with you she calls out for the guards.

EVTOPTA_ACLLA_59;I will take you all on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_59;I surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_60;It turns out [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] is not receptive to the idea of forsaking her vows, though she is somewhat flattered by the attempt and tells you that she will keep the fact that you are inside the Acllahuasi to herself instead of calling for the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_60;I think I will trust her...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_60;She is a loose end to clear up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_61;It turns out [aclla_rescue_attempt_lover.GetBestName] is not receptive to the idea of forsaking her vows, and she calls out for the guards. Since you have dealt with them already none appear, and she looks quite surprised when she realizes that things are not going as planned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_ACLLA_62;You has made your last mistake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_63;As you search the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] you start having second thoughts about what you are doing. You are interfering with matters concerning the Yupaychaspa faith, and thus interfering with the will of Inti himself, and that might not be something you want to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_63;I will continue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_63;I will head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_64;After spending some time searching the Acllahuasi for [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] you finally manage to locate her deep inside the building. She is alone when you find her, which probably is for the best, and seems quite surprised to see you after all this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_64;Come with me if you want to leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_65;[aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] is quite eager to leave, and aside from quickly gathering some useful supplies she does not waste time with her preparations. Mere minutes have passed when the declares that she is ready to leave the Acllahuasi and to return to [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_65;Follow me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_66;To your surprise, [aclla_to_rescue.GetBestName] is not as eager to leave as you would have expected. She tells you that you should not have come for her, and that she would rather remain in the Acllahuasi to do whatever is best for the Yupaychaspa faith and the Sapa Inca.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_66;If that really is what you want...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_66;It wasn't a request!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_67;[From.GetBestName] is not willing to leave you in the Acllahuasi, telling you that it is far too dangerous and that you will regret it one day. [From.GetSheHeCap] starts dragging you along, heading towards the nearest exit, and you need to decide if you want to do something about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_67;I guess [From.GetSheHe] knows best...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_67;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_68;[From.GetBestName] is not willing to leave you in the Acllahuasi, telling you that it is far too dangerous and that you will regret it one day. Knowing that this is neither what Inti nor what the Sapa Inca would want, you see only one thing to do at this point.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_68;Guards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_69;[From.GetBestName] is most unwilling to come with you from the Acllahuasi, even going as far as to call for the guards to come and stop you from taking her. As you have dealt with them previously, none appear, and she seems quite suprised by this development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_69;See! Nobody cares!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ACLLA_84;At long last you have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Having been in the the Acllahuasi for quite some time, you are somewhat unaccustomed to what it is like to be elsewhere, but you suppose you will get used to it soon enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_84;Home at last!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_85;It has been some time since [From.GetBestName] rescued you from the Acllahuasi, and your romantic relationship is still ongoing. Lately, you have been considering the future, as it is quite possible that [From.GetBestName] and you could have a more formal relationship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_85;Surely he wants to marry me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_85;Surely he wants me as a concubine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_85;Surely this is enough for both of us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_86;[From.GetBestName], the former Aclla that you rescued from the Acllahuasi and have been taking to your bed ever since approached you today, suggesting that perhaps it would be right and proper for the two of you to get married.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_86;An excellent suggestion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_86;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_87;[From.GetBestName], the former Aclla that you rescued from the Acllahuasi and have been taking to your bed ever since approached you today, suggesting that perhaps it would be right and proper for you to take her as an official concubine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_87;An excellent suggestion!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_87;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

yana_aclla_desc;This woman turned out not to be a very impressive Aclla, and she has been made a servant to one of the Sapa Inca's vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_89;A messenger arrived from the Acllahuasi today, carrying a missive informing you that [From.GetBestName], your [From.GetRelation], has been deemed a Yurac Aclla, which means that she is destinied to be sacrificed to the gods at a time when this would be beneficial for the Yupaychaspa faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_89;It is an honor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_89;I must rescue her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ACLLA_89_GET_BACK_DAUGHTER;You will look for opportunities to retrieve [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_90;Your Willaq Umu presents before you a new girl who has just been selected from the Acllahuasi as a Huayru Aclla, [From.GetBestName]. The priests have ordained that she is to wed the Sapa Inca. Will you take her as a wife?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_90;Such a beautiful specimen? It would be my pleasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_90;Something for my heir, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_90;One of my vassals can have her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_91;Your [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], who was taken for the Acllahuasi years ago, has grown up to be a prime example of beauty, talent and decorum. She has become a wife of the Sapa Inca himself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_91;We are all very proud of her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_93;The Acllahuasi of Cuzco has sent to you a Yurac Aclla. [From.GetFirstName] is one of the finest women to graduate from the sacred convent, and you have been blessed by the Sapa Inca to marry her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_93;Everything for the Sapa Inca!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_93;Something for my heir, perhaps?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ACLLA_93;Sacred or not, she is not my type.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_94;Your [GetFromFromRelation] [FromFrom.GetFirstName], who was taken for the Acllahuasi years ago, has grown up to be a fine example of beauty, talent and decorum. She has been wedded to [FromFrom.Spouse.GetBestName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_94;She will have a good life there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_95;Not all who leave the Aclla do so as perfect examples of femininity. [From.GetBestName] has been deemed flawed in one way or another, but she still has skill, and the Willaq Umu designated her to you as a loyal servant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_95;I'm sure I'll be able to make use of her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_97;I was lost in thoughts during the latest feast, and not pleasant ones either. But [aclla_servant.GetFirstName] caught my attention, and demonstrated a dance from the Apurimac valley. It was wild, yet elegant, and her bracelets loudly rattled with each vigorous movement. The entrancing dance made me forget all about my worries...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_97;Such energy, such grace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_98;One evening, strolling by the courtyard, I come across [aclla_servant.GetFirstName], singing songs about the glory of Inti. Her voice could go high as a songbird and low as a llama, as loud as the sunrise and as soft as a whisper. It made the hairs in my neck rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_98;H-how does she do it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_99;I sit in my room, gnashing my teeth with worries over the problems in my realm. Suddenly I hear a knock on the door, and [aclla_servant.GetFirstName] comes in carrying a small bowl. 'Have some Chica, my [Root.GetLordLady]' she says with a rascally grin. 'Beer doesn't judge, beer only listens.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_99;Indeed it does!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_100;The past months I have not been getting much sleep - I have been insomniac with distress over the state of my realm. However, [aclla_servant.GetFirstName]'s treats are doing their best to relieve that. She bakes the best sancu bread, and frankly, gorging on her delicacies has put my mind at rest more than I'd be willing to admit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_100;That was most definitely an excellent meal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_108;An emissary from the Imperial Palace arrived today, bringing the heavenly news that your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName], was recognised in the Acllahuasi for her finesse, talent and charm. She is going to receive the highest possible honors: that of Quapaq Hucha - to be sacrificed to Inti!
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_108;We are proud beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_108;Not my [GetFromRelation]... I must stop this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ACLLA_108_GET_BACK_DAUGHTER;You will look for opportunities to retrieve [From.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

qhapaq_hucha_desc;This young woman is being indoctrinated and sedated in preparation for her imminent sacrfice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_113;You have been informed that another sacrifice to Inti was recently carried out in the mountains near Cuzco. [From.GetBestName] was a shining example of beauty and virtue, and the best possible Qhapaq Hucha to present as a servant for the gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_113;Blessings upon her, and her ayllu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_114;You receive the news that after a year of preparation, [FromFrom.GetBestName] was carried to the top of the Hamp'atu mountain, and there buried alive in the rocks while a priest spoke holy words to appease the mountain gods with the sacrifice. The Sapa Ica has bestowed great honors on your family for producing such a fine young woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_114;We are very proud of her too...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_114;I will avenge her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_116;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName], your [qhapaq_hucha.GetRelation] arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName] today, accompanied by a large number of guards and priests and priestesses sworn to Inti. She is due to be sacrificed on a nearby mountain within the next few days, for the glory of the Yupaychaspa faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_116;We are proud beyond belief!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ACLLA_116;I must stop this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_117;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] is led out of [Root.Capital.GetName] accompanied by the guards and priestesses that arrived along with her from Cuzco. She does not speak to anyone as she walks, perhaps because she is resigned to her faith, or perhaps due to the drugs they have been feeding her, and she does not seem to know you are watching.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_117;I guess I will never see her again...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_118;[qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] is led out of [Root.Capital.GetName] accompanied by the guards and priestesses that arrived along with her from Cuzco. You have prepared for this moment ever since she arrived, and on your signal your soldiers create a diversion, allowing you to get close to your [qhapaq_hucha.GetRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_118;Come with me if you want to live!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_119;You and [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] sneak away as your soldiers keep the guards from Cuzco occupied. You signal your soldiers to wipe out the party from Cuzco, and they comply without hesitation, making it look like a bandit attack. As the battle is dying down, you move to comfort your [qhapaq_hucha.GetRelation].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_119;You're safe now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_120;You and [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] sneak away as your soldiers keep the guards from Cuzco occupied. Though your soldiers do their best to make it appear as if it was a bandit attack, you later learn that [meddlesome_vassal.GetBestName] saw what happened and has seen fit to inform the Sapa Inca of what you did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_120;Curse that bastard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_121;Your [qhapaq_hucha.GetRelation] [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] proves to be unwilling to come with you, and she is quite outraged that you have dared to attack the party with her. She firmly declares that she will do as Inti desires, and that you had better leave at once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_121;She's lost to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ACLLA_122;The party from Cuzco that was travelling with [qhapaq_hucha.GetBestName] has returned to [Root.Capital.GetName] and inform you that the sacrifice was carried out as planned. They tell you that you must not be sad, as what was done was done for the glory of Inti.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ACLLA_122;Glory... to Inti...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
